Although this campaign began in the U.S. back in 2004, its message is universal: no matter where you are, staying safe online should always be a priority.\n\nIn the spirit of this annual event, I’d like to share some practical tips I’ve gathered from financial institutions, cybersecurity experts, and various podcasts I follow. These suggestions will help you safeguard your digital life and keep potential cyberthreats at bay.\n\n1. Create Strong, Unique Passwords\n\nYou’ve probably heard that a strong password requires a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. But let’s face it, “aA1#” just isn’t going to cut it. Attackers can easily breach such basic combinations. In fact, weak passwords are often cracked in seconds.\n\nTo give you an idea of how long your password should be, this infographic from Response IT shows an estimate of how long passwords take to crack depending on their composition:\n\n2. Avoid Reusing Passwords\n\nOne of the most common mistakes people make is reusing the same password across multiple accounts. I’ve even had colleagues admit to using one password for everything, which is a disaster waiting to happen. If one account is breached, attackers can easily access all of your other accounts using the same password.\n\nThe solution?\n\nUse different passwords for every account. And yes, I know—coming up with unique passwords for every account can be difficult. That’s why I recommend using systems like Diceware or the Bitwarden Strong Password Generator to create secure passwords.\n\n3. Use a Password Vault\n\nAt this point, you might be wondering how on earth you’re supposed to remember all these passwords. You’re right to be concerned—managing hundreds of accounts is a challenge. That’s where password vaults come in.\n\nA password manager, like Bitwarden, securely stores all your passwords in one place. It generates strong passwords for each account and auto-fills them when you need them. Plus, you only have to remember one master password.\n\nTrust me, it’s a lifesaver. (And no, Bitwarden didn’t pay me to say that!)\n\n4. Monitor Your Email\n\nKeeping an eye on your email accounts is crucial, but it’s more than just checking your inbox. You need to ensure that your email hasn’t been compromised in a data breach. Tools like Firefox Monitor can help. By entering your email, you can see whether it’s been involved in any breaches, and you can even sign up for alerts in case it happens in the future.\n\n5. Be Mindful of Every Click\n\nCybercriminals often prey on impatience or carelessness. Whether you’re clicking a link, downloading a file, or making a payment, be mindful.\n\nAsk yourself: does this seem too good to be true? If something feels off, don’t rush—double-check before you act.\n\n6. Stay Calm, Don’t Panic\n\nLastly, never let yourself be rushed or panicked into making a quick decision online. Your bank, or any legitimate institution, will never push you to take immediate action without giving you time to think.\n\nScammers thrive on urgency. If you feel pressured by an unexpected message or call, stop, breathe, and take a moment before doing anything. This simple pause could save you from a costly mistake.\n\nThese are just a few simple tips that I hope will help you stay safer in your online life. Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving field, and there’s always more to learn. If you have any additional tips or personal experiences to share, feel free to drop them in the comments.\n\nStay vigilant, and happy browsing!\n\n(This post may be updated in the future with more tips or followed up with a deeper dive into cybersecurity best practices.)\n\nOriginally posted on October 27, 2022 at Substack.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/security-4851426.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-09-10 08:57:33","updated_at":"2024-09-10 09:22:54","published_at":"2024-08-12 00:00:00","custom_excerpt":"Practical steps that you can take in order to stay safe online.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66e18b9a900831571ef4d691","uuid":"4e1a3b3b-1045-4400-bc31-e28e3ed6b5ec","title":"Beyond the \"Good Job\": Breaking Free from Traditional Career Goals","slug":"beyond-the-good-job-breaking-free-from-traditional-career-goals","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Defining my job has always been a tricky conversation, especially where I come from.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"It’s not a concept easily understood by most people I meet.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"One morning, someone asked my mother what I did for work.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Her answer? “She works on the Internet.”\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The follow-up question was, “Oh, at an Internet café?

Stay on Track with a Task Management App\n    \n    A task management app is perfect for staying on top of assignments, deadlines, and to-dos.\n    \n    You can list out everything you need to accomplish and organize it into priorities.\n    \n    This way, you’re not only managing your time but also tracking your progress toward the bigger goal—passing your board exams.\n    \n 4. Block Out Distractions with a White Noise Generator\n    \n    Whether it’s noisy neighbors or your phone constantly pinging, distractions are everywhere.\n    \n    A white noise generator can be a lifesaver when it comes to maintaining focus.\n    \n    By creating a consistent auditory backdrop, it helps drown out disruptions so you can dive deeper into your study material without getting sidetracked.\n    \n 5. Track Your Hours with a Time Tracker\n    \n    Want to know exactly where your study hours are going?\n    \n    A time tracking tool can show you how much time you’re actually spending on each subject.\n    \n    This helps you adjust your schedule if needed and ensures you’re dedicating the right amount of time to each exam topic.\n\nBy implementing these tools and techniques, you can transform your study routine into a more productive and organized system.\n\nTime management is key, and these strategies will help you stay focused, make steady progress, increase your chances of passing your board exams with flying colors, and becoming a Registered Criminologist.\n\nRemember, the right tools can give you the edge you need to reach your goals.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/09/planning-250091.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-09-11 15:35:24","updated_at":"2024-11-13 04:17:03","published_at":"2024-08-19 00:00:00","custom_excerpt":"Mastering time management with the right tools can streamline your study sessions and boost your chances of exam success.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66e1bc16900831571ef4d710","uuid":"a8a590cc-c057-474f-b6c9-be85e56fcd91","title":"Feeling Overwhelmed at College?

But hackers frequently exploit weak or reused passwords, so adding 2FA creates an extra layer of security.\n\nIn 2019, Google showed that implementing 2FA reduced compromised accounts drastically.\n\nEven simple methods like SMS-based 2FA can block up to 99.9% of automated attacks.\n\nUnfortunately, many Filipinos still don’t enable 2FA, leaving them vulnerable.\n\nThe 2012 LinkedIn data breach is a classic example of why strong, unique passwords and additional security measures like 2FA are critical.\n\nLocal banks like BDO have pushed for stronger cybersecurity practices by encouraging customers to enable 2FA and use password managers. This effort is in response to rising cases of online fraud targeting Filipino consumers.\n\nCybercrime is evolving, but so can you.\n\nBy staying informed about cybercriminal tactics and making simple adjustments like enabling two-factor authentication or regularly backing up your data, you can stay ahead of the threats.\n\nThe digital world may be dangerous, but with the right precautions, you can navigate it safely.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/10/Leonardo_Phoenix_A_dark_stylized_illustration_of_a_globe_with_2.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-10-05 18:24:25","updated_at":"2024-10-05 19:04:42","published_at":"2024-08-30 00:00:00","custom_excerpt":"Cybercrime is evolving, and it’s no longer just a problem for big corporations.

To stay secure, we must remain proactive and adaptable.\n\n\nThe Tech War on Crime: Fighting Back with Innovation\n\nAs cybercrime advances, so does our ability to fight it.\n\nTechnology is now our strongest ally in outpacing criminals, with tools like drones, artificial intelligence, and big data leading the charge.\n\nDrones have revolutionized surveillance, allowing law enforcement to monitor large areas and track suspects in real time. In the Philippines, drones are being deployed to in surveillance missions to enhance the country's monitoring capabilities, especially in the coasts and shorelines\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is another game-changer in modern policing. By analyzing massive datasets, AI can predict where crimes are likely to occur and help allocate resources accordingly.\n\nPredictive policing has already shown success in reducing violent crime in places like Los Angeles, and its potential continues to grow.\n\nData analytics plays a critical role as well. By processing data from social media, CCTV footage, and other sources, law enforcement can track and dismantle criminal organizations more efficiently.\n\nIn the Philippines, data analytics has helped authorities combat human trafficking and cybercrime, leading to successful arrests.\n\nInnovation is our strongest weapon in the war on cybercrime. As technology evolves, so too do our methods of fighting back.\n\n\nAI vs. Criminals: The Ongoing Battle for Cyber Supremacy\n\nArtificial intelligence is not just a tool for law enforcement—it’s also becoming one of the most powerful weapons in a cybercriminal’s arsenal.\n\nOn the defensive side, AI helps detect threats in real time, scanning vast amounts of data for suspicious activity. The global AI cybersecurity market is expected to reach $46 billion by 2027 as more organizations rely on AI to enhance their security measures.\n\nHowever, the same technology that protects us can also be used against us.\n\nCybercriminals are leveraging AI to automate phishing attacks, crack passwords, and even create AI-powered malware. In 2020, researchers uncovered an AI-based malware that could bypass traditional security measures by learning from past breaches.\n\nThe battle between AI and criminals is an ongoing arms race, with both sides constantly evolving. But despite the challenges, AI remains one of the most effective tools in staying one step ahead of today’s smartest criminals.\n\nAI is a double-edged sword in the fight against cybercrime. While it offers incredible protection, we must be aware that criminals are using it, too.\n\nCybercrime is evolving at a pace we’ve never seen before.\n\nFrom AI-powered attacks to the rise of ransomware, the digital battlefield is becoming more complex. But with the right tools and knowledge, we can outpace these criminals and protect ourselves in this new age of digital crime.\n\nStay informed, stay proactive, and always be one step ahead.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/10/Leonardo_Phoenix_An_image_of_a_glowing_computer_screen_showing_1.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-10-06 06:19:40","updated_at":"2024-10-06 06:33:56","published_at":"2024-09-02 00:00:00","custom_excerpt":"From AI-powered attacks to ransomware, the future of crime has moved online—learn how to stay ahead of the threats in this digital age.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67024cfd743f7d306e3aa032","uuid":"8c71a27c-b9e3-44b0-9dcb-d737233724aa","title":"Ditch Chrome: 3 Browsers That Can Keep Your Privacy Safe Online","slug":"ditch-chrome-3-browsers-that-can-keep-your-privacy-safe-online","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Most people rely on Google Chrome as their go-to browser, but the reality is that Chrome is one of the most privacy-invading browsers available.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"While it may be fast and convenient, Chrome thrives on collecting vast amounts of user data, which is used to power Google's advertising business.

Lastly it will help the investigator in determining the defense mechanism of the subject which keeps the subject from having to face the reality of his actions; and by identifying and disarming these mechanisms, the interrogator can obtain admission or confession (Walters, 2002, p. 3).\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Guidelines on Custodial Investigation\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"According to the PNP Operational Procedures Manual (2011), the duties of the Police during custodial investigation are as follows:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, shall ensure that a person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall, at all times, be assisted by counsel, preferably of his own choice (PNP, 2011, p.33);\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must inform the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation of the following rights under the Miranda Doctrine in a language or dialect known to and understood by him (PNP, 2011, p-33):\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":2},{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"That he has the right to remain silent;\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":1,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"That if he waives his right to remain silent, anything he says can be used in evidence against him in court;\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":1,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":2},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"That he has the right to counsel of his own choice;\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":1,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":3},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"That, if he cannot afford one, he shall be provided with an independent and competent counsel;

The objective is to obtain accurate and reliable information while respecting human rights; eliciting facts is the aim, not a confession. In the process of interviewing suspects there is the added potential goal of obtaining an admission of guilt or a confession. However, this must not be the primary or sole purpose of the interview as even a confession must be substantiated by information and evidence. This will reduce the likelihood of a false confession and will also enable officers to present a stronger case against the suspect, should a confession later be retracted.</p><p><strong>Investigative interviewing</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<em>a technique developed by practitioners to respond to the large body of scientific evidence that abusive and coercive techniques elicit unreliable information</em>. It uses building rapport with the interviewee, which prevents abusive practices, and also improves the collection and reliability of information.

The&nbsp;<strong>Reid Technique</strong>&nbsp;involves three components namely:</p><ol><li><strong>Factual Analysis</strong><br>It is an inductive approach where each individual suspect is evaluated with respect to specific observations relating to the crime. It relies not only on crime scene analysis, but also on information learned about each suspect. Its goal is establishing an estimate of a particular suspect’s probable guilt or innocence based on such things as the suspect’s bio-social status like: gender, race, occupation, marital status, etc., opportunity and access to commit the crime, their behavior before and after the crime, their motivations and propensity to commit the crime, and evaluation of physical and circumstantial evidence (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 89).<br><br>It is also intended to identify characteristics about the suspect and the crime which will be helpful during an interrogation of the suspect believed to be guilty such as motive or the suspect’s personality type (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 99).<br></li><li><strong>Behavior Analysis Interview</strong><br>It is a non-accusatory question and answer session, involving both standard investigative questions and structured “behavior provoking” questions to elicit behavior symptoms of truth or deception from the person being interviewed. The investigator first asks background questions, to establish personal information about the suspect and allow the investigator to evaluate the suspect’s normal verbal and nonverbal behavior.<br><br>The investigator then asks behavior-provoking questions intended to elicit different verbal and nonverbal responses from truthful and deceptive suspects (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 63). The investigator will also ask some investigative questions during this stage. It provides objective criteria to render an opinion about the suspect’s truthfulness through evaluating responses to the behavior-provoking and investigative questions.<br></li><li><strong>Interrogation (NINE Steps)</strong><br>An interrogation only occurs when the investigator is reasonably certain of the suspect’s involvement in the issue under investigation (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013,<br><br>This is composed of Nine steps they are: (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 100):<ul><li><strong>Direct, Positive Confrontation</strong>&nbsp;This is where the investigator tells the suspect that the evidence demonstrates the person’s guilt. If the person’s guilt seems clear to the investigator, the statement should be unequivocal (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, р. 107).</li><li><strong>Theme Development</strong>&nbsp;This is where the investigator presents a moral justification (theme) for the offense, such as placing the moral blame on someone else or outside circumstances. The investigator presents the theme in a monologue and in a sympathetic manner (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 115).</li><li><strong>Handling Denials</strong>&nbsp;When the suspect asks for permission to speak at this stage, likely to deny the accusations, the investigator should discourage allowing the suspect to do so. The innocent suspects are less likely to ask for permission and more likely to promptly and unequivocally deny the accusation. It is very rare for an innocent suspect to move past this denial state (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, р. 139)</li><li><strong>Overcoming Objections</strong>&nbsp;When attempts at denial do not succeed, a guilty suspect often makes objections to support a claim of innocence, phrases such as I would never do that because I love my job are commonly used. The investigator should generally accept these objections as if they were truthful, rather than arguing with the suspect, and use the objections to further develop the theme (Inbau, E., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 149).</li><li><strong>Procurement and Retention of Suspect’s Attention</strong>&nbsp;The investigator must procure the suspect’s attention so that the suspect focuses on the investigator’s theme rather than on punishment. One way the investigator can do this is to close the physical distance between himself or herself and the suspect. The investigator should also channel the theme down to the probable alternative components (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 155).</li><li><strong>Handling the Suspect’s Passive Mood</strong>&nbsp;The investigator needs to intensify the theme presentation and concentrate on the central reasons he or she is offering as psychological justification and continue to display an understanding and sympathetic demeanor in urging the suspect to tell the truth (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 161).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Presenting an Alternative Question</strong>&nbsp;The investigator should present two choices, assuming the suspect’s guilt and develop as a logical extension from the theme, with one alternative offering a better justification for the crime e.g., “Did you plan this thing out or did it just happen on the spur of the moment? The investigator may follow the question with a supporting statement “which encourages the suspect to choose the more understandable side of the alternative (Inbau, E., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, р. 168).</li><li><strong>Having the Suspect Relate Details of the Offense</strong>&nbsp;After the suspect accepts one side of the alternative thus admitting guilt, the investigator should immediately respond with a statement of reinforcement acknowledging that admission. The investigator then seeks to obtain a brief oral review of the basic events, before asking more detailed questions (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 176).</li><li><strong>Converting an Oral Confession to a Written a Confession</strong>&nbsp;The investigator must convert the oral confession into a written or recorded confession.</li></ul></li></ol><h3 id=\"peace-method\">PEACE Method</h3><p>The&nbsp;<strong>PEACE model</strong>&nbsp;(<strong><em>Planning and Preparation, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, Evaluation</em></strong>) was developed in the United Kingdom in response to a number of documented forced confessions and associated wrongful convictions in the 1980s and 90s (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).</p><p><strong>Step One: Planning and Preparation</strong></p><p>It is one of the most important steps in investigative interviewing; without it, interviews may fail before they even begin.&nbsp;<strong>Planning</strong>&nbsp;refers to&nbsp;<em>the process of getting ready to interview, both mentally and strategically</em>.&nbsp;<strong>Preparation</strong>&nbsp;<em>covers what needs to be ready prior to the interview such as the location of the interview, the environment, as well as technical and administrative matters</em>.</p><h4 id=\"essential-elements-of-good-planning\">Essential Elements of Good Planning</h4><ul><li>Obtain as much background information as possible on the incident under investigation, including all relevant information on the person to be interviewed.</li><li>Understand the purpose of the interview based on an investigation plan recognizing all the relevant and competing hypotheses to be explored, including the possibility that the suspect is innocent.</li><li>Assess what additional information is needed and how it can be best obtained.</li><li>Follow the legislation and associated guidelines and rules.</li><li>Prepare the technicalities of the interview: attending to exhibits, logistics, venue, equipment functioning, seating, lawyer, interpreter, and so on (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).</li></ul><p><strong>Step Two: Engage and Explain</strong></p><p>Engaging the interviewee and establishing rapport is the first step to encouraging a conversation. It is the most influential factor in ensuring productive interviews (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017). At the outset the interviewee must be informed why they have been brought in for questioning and of the formalities that apply. Officers must be aware that being interviewed can make people nervous and conversation that calms the interviewee may be needed. However, interviewers shall not work towards a pretend “friendship” with interviewees.</p><p>The aim is to engage the interviewee so that a cooperative and relaxed relationship (one that stimulates memory and communication) is sustained throughout the interview (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 23).<br>In engaging with the interviewee the officer should seek the following (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017):</p><ol><li>Create an empathetic and respectful relationship from the outset</li><li>Explain the reasons, background, rights, formalities and procedures for the interview, including information about audio/video recording</li><li>Establish certain ground rules by telling interviewees:<ul><li>That what they have to say is important so they need to report everything they can and try their hardest not to leave anything out</li><li>Not to edit as they go even if they believe some information has no relevance to the matter being investigated</li><li>That they need to concentrate because striving to retrieve memories can be hard work</li><li>That they should feel free to speak up if the officer:<ul><li>asks a question they do not understand;</li><li>asks a question they do not know the answer to;</li><li>misunderstands what the interviewee has said; or,</li><li>asks a leading or inappropriate question</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Step Three: Account</strong></p><p>Interviewers should allow the interviewee to present their uninterrupted free account of the case or event under investigation; this is after establishing the rapport and explaining the ground rules for the interview. It is important that the interviewee is provided with the opportunity to present their side of the story, before more detailed questions are asked (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).</p><p>Three main steps in getting the free account from the interviewee:</p><ol><li>Introduce and explain the form and purpose of the free and uninterrupted account</li><li>Hand over the initiative (“give the floor”) to the victim, witness or suspect (as applicable)</li><li>Employ active listening while the interviewee presents the free and uninterrupted account</li></ol><p><strong>Active listening</strong>&nbsp;assists the interviewer to establish rapport and help elicit a full and accurate account. Use&nbsp;<strong>TED’S PIE</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Tell me, Explain, Describe Show Me – Precisely, In detail, Exactly</em>. Using this approach helps build rapport and prevents the interviewer contaminating the account being given. The TED’S PIE-approach makes use of encouragements/ invitations to obtain an account (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).</p><h3 id=\"types-of-questioning\"><strong>Types of Questioning</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Open-ended Questions</strong>&nbsp;Questions that allow the suspect to reply with longer, more detailed responses and lack direction from the interviewer. These can be questions such as; “What happened?” or questions that begin by asking the suspect to”tell”, “explain”or “describe” some event or situation (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).</li><li><strong>Closed Questions</strong>&nbsp;Questions that require more definite and distinct answers. Examples include, “What time was that?”,”Who else was present?” “What is his address?” Such questions allow more control over what the suspect says and are useful where the suspect has left out information that you need. However, they can limit the account given (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).</li><li><strong>Forced-choice Questions</strong>&nbsp;Questions that greatly restrict the possible answers to those that you have determined. The question may be “Was it a rifle or a handgun?” when the weapon may have been a shotgun. The suspect may simply pick one of the choices offered in order to please the interviewer or just move the questioning on. You should avoid these as they don’t suggest an open mind, and because answers may lie outside those conceived of by the interviewer. Do not limit the interview in this way (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).</li><li><strong>Multiple Questions</strong>&nbsp;Questioning where the interviewer asks more than one question at the same time. This can easily confuse an interviewee and make the answers given equally confusing to the interviewer. An example would be to ask, “When did he say that and what did he do and who else was present?” (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).</li><li><strong>Leading questions</strong>&nbsp;Questions that induce a particular reply and may be judged to have manipulated the interviewee. An example would be to ask,”You wanted to injure him, didn’t you?” They can lead the suspect to the point where they agree with what is being said even where they are uncertain or have no clear memory (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, р. 26).</li></ul><p><strong>Step Four: Closure</strong></p><p>As the interview comes to an end, the interviewing officer should explain what will happen next by giving the interviewee appropriate information about the next stages of the process: for example, inform suspects of potential pre-trial detention, tell witnesses whether or not they should expect to attend court, etc. (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).</p><p>Finally, the interviewee should be asked if they have any questions for the interviewing officer at this stage. This has little or no real effect if the communication has been coercive. However, if the interview has been conducted as outlined above, this question may add to the interviewee’s perception of having been treated fairly (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p.</p><p>The goal of closure are the following (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017):</p><ol><li>Ensure there is a mutual understanding of the interviewee’s account by reviewing and summarizing it</li><li>Verify that all aspects have been sufficiently covered by checking that interviewees have given all the information they are able and willing to provide</li><li>Secure the integrity and dignity of the interview, the legitimacy of any subsequent criminal proceedings, and keep channels open for future communication</li></ol><p><strong>Step Five: Evaluation</strong></p><p>This is the phase wherein the interviewer evaluates the entire process of the interview and determines if his objectives were met. He also evaluates the method he used in acquiring useful statements from the witness, victim, or suspect and the effectiveness of said method (Galero-Müftüoglu, 2017, p. 186).</p><p>If the interview is evaluated by a supervisor, senior officer or colleague, make sure that the interviewing officers are given the opportunity to comment on their own performance, before the evaluator gives their points, starting with what was positive, moving on to what could be improved next time. (Norwegian Center for Human Rights 2017)</p><h3 id=\"mendez-method\">Mendez Method</h3><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Mendez Principles</strong>, also known as the new&nbsp;<strong><em>Principles on Effective Interviewing for Investigations and Information Gathering</em></strong>. It was named after Juan Mendez, the Argentine lawyer, torture survivor, and former UN Special Rapporteur. It is a concrete alternative to interrogation methods that rely on coercion to extract confessions. They provide guidance on obtaining accurate and reliable information in full respect of the human rights and dignity of all, including through the implementation of legal and procedural safeguards in the first hours of police custody. (IRCT, 2021)</p><p>The Mendez Method has three parts; Before, During, and After the Interview.</p><p><strong>Before the Interview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ensuring a Non-Coercive Environment</strong>&nbsp;Creating a non-coercive environment involves the respect and fulfillment of human rights from the first moment of contact between the interviewee and authorities. This allows law enforcement, intelligence, security or military officials to create conditions conducive to gathering accurate and reliable information during the interview, to fulfill State obligations under international law and to protect the rights of the interviewee. Unlawful and unprofessional behavior, and a lack of accountability, at the early stages of contact may taint the overall judicial process irreversibly (Mendez, 2016, p.14-15).</li><li><strong>Keeping the Interviewee Informed</strong>&nbsp;Showing concern for the interviewee from the initial contact is the first opportunity for creating trust and rapport. This is more likely when an interviewee is given early, explicit explanations of why they have been brought in for questioning, which formalities apply, and how the interview will proceed. Explaining procedures and likely activities is an early opportunity to display sincerity, provide predictability, be respectful and attentive, and promote trust. The right to be informed by the detaining authority about the reasons for arrest applies regardless of the manner, or the formality or informality with which an arrest is conducted, and regardless of the reasons for the deprivation of liberty (Mendez, 2016, p.15). Information regarding an interviewee’s rights and how to exercise them should be conveyed verbally, in clear, non-technical, and precise language upon arrest; and it should also be provided in writing by the detaining authority upon arrival at the place of detention in a language and format they understand.</li><li><strong>Notification of Family or Third Party</strong>&nbsp;A key safeguard for detainees is their right to promptly notify a family member, friend, or other person of their choice about the fact, place and circumstances of their detention. The detaining authority is responsible for enabling the communication with the third party and recording who has been notified and when the notification took place (Mendez, 2016, p.16). Foreign nationals who are arrested or detained must be informed immediately of their right to communicate with a consular or diplomatic representative of their country of origin, and asylum seekers should be informed of their right to contact relevant international agencies. Contact is to be facilitated by the detaining authority (Mendez, 2016, p.17).</li><li><strong>Access to a Lawyer</strong>&nbsp;All detained persons being interviewed have a right to a lawyer, including through legal aid, before any questioning by authorities – independent of their status or formal designation. Access to a lawyer is inextricably linked to the protection of rights, prevention of torture and other ill-treatment, and helps to protect against compelled self-incrimination. The interviewee is entitled to a lawyer of their own choosing, or to have one provided for them free of charge where the interests of justice so require. The presence of the lawyer is compulsory for detained children interviewed as suspects (Mendez, 2016, p.17).</li><li><strong>Access to Medical Examination and Health Care</strong>&nbsp;Authorities have a duty to protect the integrity and health of all persons in their custody. Detainees must be expressly guaranteed the right of access to a doctor and the right to a medical examination by an independent health professional, without delay, from the moment of deprivation of liberty. The detaining authority is also responsible for providing detainees with access to medical care throughout their detention. The physical and mental state in which an arrested or detained person enters the detention facility, including signs or complaints of excessive force used during the arrest and transportation into custody, should be recorded by the doctor or other medical professional. Individuals who are to be interviewed must be physically and psychologically fit for that purpose (Mendez, 2016, p.18).</li><li><strong>Preparations for the Interviewer</strong>&nbsp;Once an individual has been identified as a person the authorities wish to interview, the appointed interviewer should start thorough preparations. Being fully prepared increases an interviewer’s ability to effectively communicate with interviewees, and hence, the likelihood of obtaining reliable information. Before commencing an interview it is crucial to maximize the investigative and evidentiary value of the information already gathered. When preparing for an interview – and throughout the process – interviewers should exercise caution to avoid&nbsp;<strong>confirmation bias</strong>. Interviewers should continually monitor their own emotions about the subject matter and their feelings toward the interviewee, to be able to project calm and self-control throughout the interview (Mendez, 2016, p.19).</li></ul><p><strong>During the Interview</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Establishing and Maintaining Rapport</strong>&nbsp;Effective interviewers are adaptable, listen carefully, communicate empathy, and adopt the ethos that non-coercive, humane, ethical, lawful and appropriate questioning serves the interest of all involved: the interviewer, the interviewee and the information-gathering authorities. They recognize that the interviewer’s role is to acquire the best possible information for decisions to be made. Only courts determine guilt or innocence. The development of rapport is essential in supporting effective information-gathering. During the interview, rapport entails establishing and maintaining a relationship characterized by: respect and trust; a non-judgmental mindset; non-aggressive body language; attentiveness; and patience (Mendez, 2016, p.20).<br></li><li><strong>Information-Gathering Techniques</strong>&nbsp;Active listening helps the interviewer process the information provided by the interviewee. By listening actively, the interviewer shows that they are following what the interviewee is saying and making efforts to understand. The interviewer takes care not to lead an interviewee inadvertently by using verbal or visual cues, including sounds, gestures or questions, which may be interpreted as agreeing or disagreeing with what the person is saying. Accurate summaries of what the interviewee has said may facilitate the positive progression of the interview and assist the interviewer and interviewee in recalling important details (Mendez, 2016, р.21).<br></li><li><strong>Encountering Reluctance</strong>&nbsp;Interviewers may encounter interviewees who are reluctant to talk and therefore should anticipate how they will handle such situations. Not wanting or agreeing to answer questions may be a deliberate choice. This decision must always be respected and has no bearing on the interviewee’s right to the presumption of innocence. Reasons why an interviewee might be reluctant to talk can include general anxiety or uncertainty about the process, especially if the person has never been involved in such a situation before. It is also possible that an interviewee may be willing to provide information but is unable to do so. This can be because they did not have the relevant information to begin with, or they failed to register the details. Interviewers should not draw negative inferences from the interviewee’s failure or refusal to answer questions and should remain non-judgmental when an interviewee may make admissions to crimes or convey embarrassing information (Mendez, 2016, р.21).<br></li><li><strong>Suspending the Interview</strong>&nbsp;It is appropriate and permissible for interviewers to suspend the interview in order to follow-up on information received or conduct additional enquiries. Other reasons to suspend an interview are (Mendez, 2016, р.22):<ul><li>If the interviewee requires medical attention,</li><li>If a person originally interviewed as a witness becomes a suspect in the course of an interview; and,</li><li>If the lawyer or the interviewee may request a break, for instance in order to rest or to consult in private.<br><br>A refusal to accept such a request by the interviewer may affect the reliability of information gathered from the interview.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>After the Interview: Assessment and Analysis</strong></p><p>An effective interviewer should always end the interview respectfully and on a professional note. This increases the likelihood of keeping channels open for future communication, avoids possible misunderstandings and can improve trust in public institutions.</p><p>The interviewer should review the information obtained with the interviewee and the lawyer, if involved; and, where a written record (as opposed to an audio/video recording) has been made, invite them to sign as a confirmation of the record’s accuracy. Any amendments should be recorded, and if relevant, any refusal of the interviewee to sign the interview record. Once the interview has been completed, the interviewer ensures that the information provided during the process is subject to the appropriate level of privacy and of data protection The interviewer should assess and analyze the following (Mendez, 2016, p.23):</p><ul><li>The value and reliability of the information obtained and how it fits with known evidence, information gaps and other intelligence gathered.</li><li>What further enquiries are necessary in order to advance the investigation or operation; and</li><li>Whether all relevant safeguards were applied effectively.</li></ul><h3 id=\"kinesic-interview-method\">Kinesic Interview Method</h3><p>This involves&nbsp;<em>analyzing a person’s behavior to assess deception</em>. (Orlando, 2014) The study of&nbsp;<strong>kinesics&nbsp;</strong>focuses on the observable outward physical behavior of the body in order to ascertain the person’s current emotional state and the role the body plays in communicating the information. It states that by understanding the vocabulary of the body language, along with the diagnosis of a person’s verbal output, an interviewer could more easily assess a person’s truthfulness or deception regarding current issues under discussion (Walters, 2002, p. 2). It has two phases: the Practical Kinesic Analysis Phase; and the Practical Kinesic Interrogation Phase.</p><p><strong>Practical Kinesic Analysis Phase</strong></p><p>During the analysis phase, the interviewer uses several techniques to observe and analyze the subject’s behavior in order to determine the subject’s truthful and deceptive behaviors or at least to determine those areas most sensitive to the subject and, therefore, in need of further attention through verbal inquiry. It recognizes the cues of truthful and deceptive behavior generated by the subject through:</p><ol><li><strong>Verbal Cues</strong>&nbsp;This involves the identification of symptoms of speech quality and content which give the interviewer the most productive body of data necessary to determine truth and deception.</li><li><strong>Practical Kinesic Statement Analysis</strong>&nbsp;Assessment of truth and deception through the use of verbal cues coupled with methods of human recall and symptoms made self-evident in the statement taking process.</li><li><strong>Body Language Cues</strong>&nbsp;It refers to the observable body language cues of deception that are unbalanced or inconsistent in relation to the speech cues or emotional symptoms generated by the subject at the same time.</li><li><strong>Kinesic Subject Control</strong>&nbsp;It refers to the various techniques available to the interviewer to take control and command of the interview environment. From proxemics to mirroring or the use of enhanced information gathering skills.</li><li><strong>Confession Behaviors</strong>&nbsp;It is the verbal and nonverbal acceptance cues generated by a subject who is prepared to give an admission of confession.</li></ol><p><strong>Practical Kinesic Interrogation Phase</strong></p><p>This involves the interviewer determining the subject’s frame of mind in response to the interview stress. It also helps the interviewer in determining if the subject is suffering from personality disorder or psychosis. It also helps the interviewer determine the subject’s personality type which enables him to understand how the subject thinks and to determine the subject’s strengths to be avoided and the weaknesses that can be exploited. Lastly it will help the investigator in determining the defense mechanism of the subject which keeps the subject from having to face the reality of his actions; and by identifying and disarming these mechanisms, the interrogator can obtain admission or confession (Walters, 2002, p. 3).</p><h2 id=\"guidelines-on-custodial-investigation\">Guidelines on Custodial Investigation</h2><p>According to the PNP Operational Procedures Manual (2011), the duties of the Police during custodial investigation are as follows:</p><ol><li>The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, shall ensure that a person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall, at all times, be assisted by counsel, preferably of his own choice (PNP, 2011, p.33);</li><li>The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must inform the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation of the following rights under the Miranda Doctrine in a language or dialect known to and understood by him (PNP, 2011, p-33):<ul><li>That he has the right to remain silent;</li><li>That if he waives his right to remain silent, anything he says can be used in evidence against him in court;</li><li>That he has the right to counsel of his own choice;</li><li>That, if he cannot afford one, he shall be provided with an independent and competent counsel; and,</li><li>That he has the right to be informed of such rights.</li></ul></li><li>If the person arrested, detained, or under custodial investigation opted to give a sworn statement, the arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must reduce it in writing (PNP, 2011, p.34)</li><li>The arresting officer must ensure that, before the sworn statement is signed, or thumb marked, if there is inability to read and to write, the document shall be read and adequately explained to the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation by his counsel of choice, or by the assisting counsel provided to him, in the language or dialect known to him (PNP, 2011, p.34);</li><li>The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must ensure that any extrajudicial confession made by a person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall be (PNP, 2011, p.34):<ul><li>In writing;</li><li>Signed by such person in the presence of his counsel; or</li><li>In the latter’s absence, upon a valid waiver, and in the presence of any of the parents, elder brothers and sisters, his spouse, the municipal mayor, the municipal judge, district school supervisor, priest, imam or religious minister chosen by him.<br><br>It is important to note that failure of the arresting officer, or the investigator, to observe the above mentioned procedures shall render the extrajudicial confession inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding.

The purpose of an interrogation is to elicit from the suspect or from his or her relatives or associates information that they may be suppressing in order to protect the suspect from being subjected to criminal prosecution (Galero-Müftüoglu, 2017, p. 187). The interrogation process is largely outside the governance of law except for rules concerning the admissibility at trial of confessions obtained through interrogation and limitations on the power of police to detain suspected persons against their will.\n\n\nThree Objectives of Interrogation\n\nAside from obtaining information detrimental to a suspect’s case, the following are the three objectives of interrogation (Galero-Müftüoglu, 2017, p. 188):\n\n 1. Establish the innocence of a suspect by clearing up facts that seem to point to guilt;\n 2. Obtain from the suspect or relatives and friends of the suspect:\n    * The names of accomplices;\n    * The facts and circumstances surrounding the crime;\n    * Follow-up leads provided unwittingly, or with ulterior motive, such as faking an alibi;\n    * The location of stolen goods;\n    * The location of physical evidence, such as documents, a weapon, or a burglar’s tool.\n 3. Obtain from the suspect alone:\n    * Admission This refers to the express or implied statement tending to support the suspect’s involvement in the crime, but insufficient by itself to prove guilt;\n    * Confession This pertains to an oral or written statement acknowledging guilt.\n\n\nInvestigative Interviews\n\nAn interview is a structured conversation where one person or the “interviewer” seeks to gather information from another or the “interviewee” as part of any investigation or intelligence operation. The objective is to obtain accurate and reliable information while respecting human rights; eliciting facts is the aim, not a confession. In the process of interviewing suspects there is the added potential goal of obtaining an admission of guilt or a confession. However, this must not be the primary or sole purpose of the interview as even a confession must be substantiated by information and evidence. This will reduce the likelihood of a false confession and will also enable officers to present a stronger case against the suspect, should a confession later be retracted.\n\nInvestigative interviewing is a technique developed by practitioners to respond to the large body of scientific evidence that abusive and coercive techniques elicit unreliable information. It uses building rapport with the interviewee, which prevents abusive practices, and also improves the collection and reliability of information. It is a non-coercive approach using open questions to improve the flow of communication and information. (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017)\n\n\nGoals of Investigative Interviews\n\n 1. Eliciting more accurate and reliable information during interviews.\n 2. Strengthening the capacity, efficiency, and professionalism of interviewers.\n 3. Eliminating reliance on unlawful, ineffective, and counterproductive coercive questioning techniques.\n 4. Providing successful, affordable, and accessible methods and practices with minimal resources.\n 5. Delivering more effective information-gathering operations.\n 6. Fostering greater public trust in and cooperation with criminal justice institutions.\n 7. Ensuring that no person is subjected to coercion, torture or other forms of ill treatment.\n 8. Protecting the physical and mental integrity of all persons who interact with public authorities.\n\n\nInterrogation/Interview Techniques\n\n\nReid Method\n\nReid Method, also known as The Reid Technique of Interviewing and Interrogation, is the interrogation technique widely used by police departments. The Reid Technique involves three components namely:\n\n 1. Factual Analysis\n    It is an inductive approach where each individual suspect is evaluated with respect to specific observations relating to the crime. It relies not only on crime scene analysis, but also on information learned about each suspect. Its goal is establishing an estimate of a particular suspect’s probable guilt or innocence based on such things as the suspect’s bio-social status like: gender, race, occupation, marital status, etc., opportunity and access to commit the crime, their behavior before and after the crime, their motivations and propensity to commit the crime, and evaluation of physical and circumstantial evidence (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 89).\n    \n    It is also intended to identify characteristics about the suspect and the crime which will be helpful during an interrogation of the suspect believed to be guilty such as motive or the suspect’s personality type (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 99).\n    \n 2. Behavior Analysis Interview\n    It is a non-accusatory question and answer session, involving both standard investigative questions and structured “behavior provoking” questions to elicit behavior symptoms of truth or deception from the person being interviewed. The investigator first asks background questions, to establish personal information about the suspect and allow the investigator to evaluate the suspect’s normal verbal and nonverbal behavior.\n    \n    The investigator then asks behavior-provoking questions intended to elicit different verbal and nonverbal responses from truthful and deceptive suspects (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 63). The investigator will also ask some investigative questions during this stage. It provides objective criteria to render an opinion about the suspect’s truthfulness through evaluating responses to the behavior-provoking and investigative questions.\n    \n 3. Interrogation (NINE Steps)\n    An interrogation only occurs when the investigator is reasonably certain of the suspect’s involvement in the issue under investigation (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013,\n    \n    This is composed of Nine steps they are: (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 100):\n    * Direct, Positive Confrontation This is where the investigator tells the suspect that the evidence demonstrates the person’s guilt. If the person’s guilt seems clear to the investigator, the statement should be unequivocal (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, р. 107).\n    * Theme Development This is where the investigator presents a moral justification (theme) for the offense, such as placing the moral blame on someone else or outside circumstances. The investigator presents the theme in a monologue and in a sympathetic manner (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 115).\n    * Handling Denials When the suspect asks for permission to speak at this stage, likely to deny the accusations, the investigator should discourage allowing the suspect to do so. The innocent suspects are less likely to ask for permission and more likely to promptly and unequivocally deny the accusation. It is very rare for an innocent suspect to move past this denial state (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, р. 139)\n    * Overcoming Objections When attempts at denial do not succeed, a guilty suspect often makes objections to support a claim of innocence, phrases such as I would never do that because I love my job are commonly used. The investigator should generally accept these objections as if they were truthful, rather than arguing with the suspect, and use the objections to further develop the theme (Inbau, E., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 149).\n    * Procurement and Retention of Suspect’s Attention The investigator must procure the suspect’s attention so that the suspect focuses on the investigator’s theme rather than on punishment. One way the investigator can do this is to close the physical distance between himself or herself and the suspect. The investigator should also channel the theme down to the probable alternative components (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 155).\n    * Handling the Suspect’s Passive Mood The investigator needs to intensify the theme presentation and concentrate on the central reasons he or she is offering as psychological justification and continue to display an understanding and sympathetic demeanor in urging the suspect to tell the truth (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 161). \n    * Presenting an Alternative Question The investigator should present two choices, assuming the suspect’s guilt and develop as a logical extension from the theme, with one alternative offering a better justification for the crime e.g., “Did you plan this thing out or did it just happen on the spur of the moment? The investigator may follow the question with a supporting statement “which encourages the suspect to choose the more understandable side of the alternative (Inbau, E., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, р. 168).\n    * Having the Suspect Relate Details of the Offense After the suspect accepts one side of the alternative thus admitting guilt, the investigator should immediately respond with a statement of reinforcement acknowledging that admission. The investigator then seeks to obtain a brief oral review of the basic events, before asking more detailed questions (Inbau, F., Reid, J.E., Buckley, J. et al., 2013, p. 176).\n    * Converting an Oral Confession to a Written a Confession The investigator must convert the oral confession into a written or recorded confession.\n\n\nPEACE Method\n\nThe PEACE model (Planning and Preparation, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure, Evaluation) was developed in the United Kingdom in response to a number of documented forced confessions and associated wrongful convictions in the 1980s and 90s (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).\n\nStep One: Planning and Preparation\n\nIt is one of the most important steps in investigative interviewing; without it, interviews may fail before they even begin. Planning refers to the process of getting ready to interview, both mentally and strategically. Preparation covers what needs to be ready prior to the interview such as the location of the interview, the environment, as well as technical and administrative matters.\n\nEssential Elements of Good Planning\n\n * Obtain as much background information as possible on the incident under investigation, including all relevant information on the person to be interviewed.\n * Understand the purpose of the interview based on an investigation plan recognizing all the relevant and competing hypotheses to be explored, including the possibility that the suspect is innocent.\n * Assess what additional information is needed and how it can be best obtained.\n * Follow the legislation and associated guidelines and rules.\n * Prepare the technicalities of the interview: attending to exhibits, logistics, venue, equipment functioning, seating, lawyer, interpreter, and so on (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).\n\nStep Two: Engage and Explain\n\nEngaging the interviewee and establishing rapport is the first step to encouraging a conversation. It is the most influential factor in ensuring productive interviews (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017). At the outset the interviewee must be informed why they have been brought in for questioning and of the formalities that apply. Officers must be aware that being interviewed can make people nervous and conversation that calms the interviewee may be needed. However, interviewers shall not work towards a pretend “friendship” with interviewees.\n\nThe aim is to engage the interviewee so that a cooperative and relaxed relationship (one that stimulates memory and communication) is sustained throughout the interview (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 23).\nIn engaging with the interviewee the officer should seek the following (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017):\n\n 1. Create an empathetic and respectful relationship from the outset\n 2. Explain the reasons, background, rights, formalities and procedures for the interview, including information about audio/video recording\n 3. Establish certain ground rules by telling interviewees:\n    * That what they have to say is important so they need to report everything they can and try their hardest not to leave anything out\n    * Not to edit as they go even if they believe some information has no relevance to the matter being investigated\n    * That they need to concentrate because striving to retrieve memories can be hard work\n    * That they should feel free to speak up if the officer:\n      * asks a question they do not understand;\n      * asks a question they do not know the answer to;\n      * misunderstands what the interviewee has said; or,\n      * asks a leading or inappropriate question\n\nStep Three: Account\n\nInterviewers should allow the interviewee to present their uninterrupted free account of the case or event under investigation; this is after establishing the rapport and explaining the ground rules for the interview. It is important that the interviewee is provided with the opportunity to present their side of the story, before more detailed questions are asked (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).\n\nThree main steps in getting the free account from the interviewee:\n\n 1. Introduce and explain the form and purpose of the free and uninterrupted account\n 2. Hand over the initiative (“give the floor”) to the victim, witness or suspect (as applicable)\n 3. Employ active listening while the interviewee presents the free and uninterrupted account\n\nActive listening assists the interviewer to establish rapport and help elicit a full and accurate account. Use TED’S PIE: Tell me, Explain, Describe Show Me – Precisely, In detail, Exactly. Using this approach helps build rapport and prevents the interviewer contaminating the account being given. The TED’S PIE-approach makes use of encouragements/ invitations to obtain an account (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).\n\n\nTypes of Questioning\n\n * Open-ended Questions Questions that allow the suspect to reply with longer, more detailed responses and lack direction from the interviewer. These can be questions such as; “What happened?” or questions that begin by asking the suspect to”tell”, “explain”or “describe” some event or situation (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).\n * Closed Questions Questions that require more definite and distinct answers. Examples include, “What time was that?”,”Who else was present?” “What is his address?” Such questions allow more control over what the suspect says and are useful where the suspect has left out information that you need. However, they can limit the account given (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).\n * Forced-choice Questions Questions that greatly restrict the possible answers to those that you have determined. The question may be “Was it a rifle or a handgun?” when the weapon may have been a shotgun. The suspect may simply pick one of the choices offered in order to please the interviewer or just move the questioning on. You should avoid these as they don’t suggest an open mind, and because answers may lie outside those conceived of by the interviewer. Do not limit the interview in this way (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).\n * Multiple Questions Questioning where the interviewer asks more than one question at the same time. This can easily confuse an interviewee and make the answers given equally confusing to the interviewer. An example would be to ask, “When did he say that and what did he do and who else was present?” (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p. 26).\n * Leading questions Questions that induce a particular reply and may be judged to have manipulated the interviewee. An example would be to ask,”You wanted to injure him, didn’t you?” They can lead the suspect to the point where they agree with what is being said even where they are uncertain or have no clear memory (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, р. 26).\n\nStep Four: Closure\n\nAs the interview comes to an end, the interviewing officer should explain what will happen next by giving the interviewee appropriate information about the next stages of the process: for example, inform suspects of potential pre-trial detention, tell witnesses whether or not they should expect to attend court, etc. (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017).\n\nFinally, the interviewee should be asked if they have any questions for the interviewing officer at this stage. This has little or no real effect if the communication has been coercive. However, if the interview has been conducted as outlined above, this question may add to the interviewee’s perception of having been treated fairly (Boyle, and Vullierme, 2015, p.\n\nThe goal of closure are the following (Norwegian Center for Human Rights, 2017):\n\n 1. Ensure there is a mutual understanding of the interviewee’s account by reviewing and summarizing it\n 2. Verify that all aspects have been sufficiently covered by checking that interviewees have given all the information they are able and willing to provide\n 3. Secure the integrity and dignity of the interview, the legitimacy of any subsequent criminal proceedings, and keep channels open for future communication\n\nStep Five: Evaluation\n\nThis is the phase wherein the interviewer evaluates the entire process of the interview and determines if his objectives were met. He also evaluates the method he used in acquiring useful statements from the witness, victim, or suspect and the effectiveness of said method (Galero-Müftüoglu, 2017, p. 186).\n\nIf the interview is evaluated by a supervisor, senior officer or colleague, make sure that the interviewing officers are given the opportunity to comment on their own performance, before the evaluator gives their points, starting with what was positive, moving on to what could be improved next time. (Norwegian Center for Human Rights 2017)\n\n\nMendez Method\n\nThe Mendez Principles, also known as the new Principles on Effective Interviewing for Investigations and Information Gathering. It was named after Juan Mendez, the Argentine lawyer, torture survivor, and former UN Special Rapporteur. It is a concrete alternative to interrogation methods that rely on coercion to extract confessions. They provide guidance on obtaining accurate and reliable information in full respect of the human rights and dignity of all, including through the implementation of legal and procedural safeguards in the first hours of police custody. (IRCT, 2021)\n\nThe Mendez Method has three parts; Before, During, and After the Interview.\n\nBefore the Interview\n\n * Ensuring a Non-Coercive Environment Creating a non-coercive environment involves the respect and fulfillment of human rights from the first moment of contact between the interviewee and authorities. This allows law enforcement, intelligence, security or military officials to create conditions conducive to gathering accurate and reliable information during the interview, to fulfill State obligations under international law and to protect the rights of the interviewee. Unlawful and unprofessional behavior, and a lack of accountability, at the early stages of contact may taint the overall judicial process irreversibly (Mendez, 2016, p.14-15).\n * Keeping the Interviewee Informed Showing concern for the interviewee from the initial contact is the first opportunity for creating trust and rapport. This is more likely when an interviewee is given early, explicit explanations of why they have been brought in for questioning, which formalities apply, and how the interview will proceed. Explaining procedures and likely activities is an early opportunity to display sincerity, provide predictability, be respectful and attentive, and promote trust. The right to be informed by the detaining authority about the reasons for arrest applies regardless of the manner, or the formality or informality with which an arrest is conducted, and regardless of the reasons for the deprivation of liberty (Mendez, 2016, p.15). Information regarding an interviewee’s rights and how to exercise them should be conveyed verbally, in clear, non-technical, and precise language upon arrest; and it should also be provided in writing by the detaining authority upon arrival at the place of detention in a language and format they understand.\n * Notification of Family or Third Party A key safeguard for detainees is their right to promptly notify a family member, friend, or other person of their choice about the fact, place and circumstances of their detention. The detaining authority is responsible for enabling the communication with the third party and recording who has been notified and when the notification took place (Mendez, 2016, p.16). Foreign nationals who are arrested or detained must be informed immediately of their right to communicate with a consular or diplomatic representative of their country of origin, and asylum seekers should be informed of their right to contact relevant international agencies. Contact is to be facilitated by the detaining authority (Mendez, 2016, p.17).\n * Access to a Lawyer All detained persons being interviewed have a right to a lawyer, including through legal aid, before any questioning by authorities – independent of their status or formal designation. Access to a lawyer is inextricably linked to the protection of rights, prevention of torture and other ill-treatment, and helps to protect against compelled self-incrimination. The interviewee is entitled to a lawyer of their own choosing, or to have one provided for them free of charge where the interests of justice so require. The presence of the lawyer is compulsory for detained children interviewed as suspects (Mendez, 2016, p.17).\n * Access to Medical Examination and Health Care Authorities have a duty to protect the integrity and health of all persons in their custody. Detainees must be expressly guaranteed the right of access to a doctor and the right to a medical examination by an independent health professional, without delay, from the moment of deprivation of liberty. The detaining authority is also responsible for providing detainees with access to medical care throughout their detention. The physical and mental state in which an arrested or detained person enters the detention facility, including signs or complaints of excessive force used during the arrest and transportation into custody, should be recorded by the doctor or other medical professional. Individuals who are to be interviewed must be physically and psychologically fit for that purpose (Mendez, 2016, p.18).\n * Preparations for the Interviewer Once an individual has been identified as a person the authorities wish to interview, the appointed interviewer should start thorough preparations. Being fully prepared increases an interviewer’s ability to effectively communicate with interviewees, and hence, the likelihood of obtaining reliable information. Before commencing an interview it is crucial to maximize the investigative and evidentiary value of the information already gathered. When preparing for an interview – and throughout the process – interviewers should exercise caution to avoid confirmation bias. Interviewers should continually monitor their own emotions about the subject matter and their feelings toward the interviewee, to be able to project calm and self-control throughout the interview (Mendez, 2016, p.19).\n\nDuring the Interview\n\n * Establishing and Maintaining Rapport Effective interviewers are adaptable, listen carefully, communicate empathy, and adopt the ethos that non-coercive, humane, ethical, lawful and appropriate questioning serves the interest of all involved: the interviewer, the interviewee and the information-gathering authorities. They recognize that the interviewer’s role is to acquire the best possible information for decisions to be made. Only courts determine guilt or innocence. The development of rapport is essential in supporting effective information-gathering. During the interview, rapport entails establishing and maintaining a relationship characterized by: respect and trust; a non-judgmental mindset; non-aggressive body language; attentiveness; and patience (Mendez, 2016, p.20).\n   \n * Information-Gathering Techniques Active listening helps the interviewer process the information provided by the interviewee. By listening actively, the interviewer shows that they are following what the interviewee is saying and making efforts to understand. The interviewer takes care not to lead an interviewee inadvertently by using verbal or visual cues, including sounds, gestures or questions, which may be interpreted as agreeing or disagreeing with what the person is saying. Accurate summaries of what the interviewee has said may facilitate the positive progression of the interview and assist the interviewer and interviewee in recalling important details (Mendez, 2016, р.21).\n   \n * Encountering Reluctance Interviewers may encounter interviewees who are reluctant to talk and therefore should anticipate how they will handle such situations. Not wanting or agreeing to answer questions may be a deliberate choice. This decision must always be respected and has no bearing on the interviewee’s right to the presumption of innocence. Reasons why an interviewee might be reluctant to talk can include general anxiety or uncertainty about the process, especially if the person has never been involved in such a situation before. It is also possible that an interviewee may be willing to provide information but is unable to do so. This can be because they did not have the relevant information to begin with, or they failed to register the details. Interviewers should not draw negative inferences from the interviewee’s failure or refusal to answer questions and should remain non-judgmental when an interviewee may make admissions to crimes or convey embarrassing information (Mendez, 2016, р.21).\n   \n * Suspending the Interview It is appropriate and permissible for interviewers to suspend the interview in order to follow-up on information received or conduct additional enquiries. Other reasons to suspend an interview are (Mendez, 2016, р.22):\n   * If the interviewee requires medical attention,\n   * If a person originally interviewed as a witness becomes a suspect in the course of an interview; and,\n   * If the lawyer or the interviewee may request a break, for instance in order to rest or to consult in private.\n     \n     A refusal to accept such a request by the interviewer may affect the reliability of information gathered from the interview.\n\nAfter the Interview: Assessment and Analysis\n\nAn effective interviewer should always end the interview respectfully and on a professional note. This increases the likelihood of keeping channels open for future communication, avoids possible misunderstandings and can improve trust in public institutions.\n\nThe interviewer should review the information obtained with the interviewee and the lawyer, if involved; and, where a written record (as opposed to an audio/video recording) has been made, invite them to sign as a confirmation of the record’s accuracy. Any amendments should be recorded, and if relevant, any refusal of the interviewee to sign the interview record. Once the interview has been completed, the interviewer ensures that the information provided during the process is subject to the appropriate level of privacy and of data protection The interviewer should assess and analyze the following (Mendez, 2016, p.23):\n\n * The value and reliability of the information obtained and how it fits with known evidence, information gaps and other intelligence gathered.\n * What further enquiries are necessary in order to advance the investigation or operation; and\n * Whether all relevant safeguards were applied effectively.\n\n\nKinesic Interview Method\n\nThis involves analyzing a person’s behavior to assess deception. (Orlando, 2014) The study of kinesics focuses on the observable outward physical behavior of the body in order to ascertain the person’s current emotional state and the role the body plays in communicating the information. It states that by understanding the vocabulary of the body language, along with the diagnosis of a person’s verbal output, an interviewer could more easily assess a person’s truthfulness or deception regarding current issues under discussion (Walters, 2002, p. 2). It has two phases: the Practical Kinesic Analysis Phase; and the Practical Kinesic Interrogation Phase.\n\nPractical Kinesic Analysis Phase\n\nDuring the analysis phase, the interviewer uses several techniques to observe and analyze the subject’s behavior in order to determine the subject’s truthful and deceptive behaviors or at least to determine those areas most sensitive to the subject and, therefore, in need of further attention through verbal inquiry. It recognizes the cues of truthful and deceptive behavior generated by the subject through:\n\n 1. Verbal Cues This involves the identification of symptoms of speech quality and content which give the interviewer the most productive body of data necessary to determine truth and deception.\n 2. Practical Kinesic Statement Analysis Assessment of truth and deception through the use of verbal cues coupled with methods of human recall and symptoms made self-evident in the statement taking process.\n 3. Body Language Cues It refers to the observable body language cues of deception that are unbalanced or inconsistent in relation to the speech cues or emotional symptoms generated by the subject at the same time.\n 4. Kinesic Subject Control It refers to the various techniques available to the interviewer to take control and command of the interview environment. From proxemics to mirroring or the use of enhanced information gathering skills.\n 5. Confession Behaviors It is the verbal and nonverbal acceptance cues generated by a subject who is prepared to give an admission of confession.\n\nPractical Kinesic Interrogation Phase\n\nThis involves the interviewer determining the subject’s frame of mind in response to the interview stress. It also helps the interviewer in determining if the subject is suffering from personality disorder or psychosis. It also helps the interviewer determine the subject’s personality type which enables him to understand how the subject thinks and to determine the subject’s strengths to be avoided and the weaknesses that can be exploited. Lastly it will help the investigator in determining the defense mechanism of the subject which keeps the subject from having to face the reality of his actions; and by identifying and disarming these mechanisms, the interrogator can obtain admission or confession (Walters, 2002, p. 3).\n\n\nGuidelines on Custodial Investigation\n\nAccording to the PNP Operational Procedures Manual (2011), the duties of the Police during custodial investigation are as follows:\n\n 1. The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, shall ensure that a person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall, at all times, be assisted by counsel, preferably of his own choice (PNP, 2011, p.33);\n 2. The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must inform the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation of the following rights under the Miranda Doctrine in a language or dialect known to and understood by him (PNP, 2011, p-33):\n    * That he has the right to remain silent;\n    * That if he waives his right to remain silent, anything he says can be used in evidence against him in court;\n    * That he has the right to counsel of his own choice;\n    * That, if he cannot afford one, he shall be provided with an independent and competent counsel; and,\n    * That he has the right to be informed of such rights.\n 3. If the person arrested, detained, or under custodial investigation opted to give a sworn statement, the arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must reduce it in writing (PNP, 2011, p.34)\n 4. The arresting officer must ensure that, before the sworn statement is signed, or thumb marked, if there is inability to read and to write, the document shall be read and adequately explained to the person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation by his counsel of choice, or by the assisting counsel provided to him, in the language or dialect known to him (PNP, 2011, p.34);\n 5. The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must ensure that any extrajudicial confession made by a person arrested, detained or under custodial investigation shall be (PNP, 2011, p.34):\n    * In writing;\n    * Signed by such person in the presence of his counsel; or\n    * In the latter’s absence, upon a valid waiver, and in the presence of any of the parents, elder brothers and sisters, his spouse, the municipal mayor, the municipal judge, district school supervisor, priest, imam or religious minister chosen by him.\n      \n      It is important to note that failure of the arresting officer, or the investigator, to observe the above mentioned procedures shall render the extrajudicial confession inadmissible as evidence in any proceeding. (PNP, 2011, p.34)\n 6. The arresting officer, or the investigator, as the case may be, must, under established regulations, allow the person arrested, detained, or under custodial investigation visits by or conferences with the following:\n    * any member of his immediate family,\n    * any medical doctor,\n    * priest, imam or religious minister chosen by him or by any member of his immediate family or by his counsel, or by any local Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) duly accredited by the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) or by any international NGO duly accredited by the Office of the President.\n 7. After interrogation, a person under custodial investigation shall have the right to be informed of his right to demand physical examination by an independent and competent doctor of his own choice. If he cannot afford the services of a doctor of his own choice, he shall be provided by the State with a competent and independent doctor to conduct physical examination. If the person arrested is female, she shall be attended to preferably by a female doctor (PNP, 2011,\n    p.34-35).\n    \n    The physical examination of the person under custodial investigation shall be contained in a medical report, which shall be attached to the custodial investigation report.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-specialized_crime_inv_2-5.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-11 08:50:55","updated_at":"2024-11-11 14:52:06","published_at":"2024-07-01 10:04:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-full-feature-image","canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67321a236bf85713393109bf","uuid":"b96bf736-165c-4f2d-8bd0-809d713de771","title":"Technical English 1: Investigative Report Writing and Presentation","slug":"technical-english-1-investigative-report-writing-and-presentation","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The course covers the study of the concept of application of the appropriate report writing, office memorandum and correspondence.

It explains the forms and structures of words (morphology) and how they are supposed to be arranged in sentences (syntax). These rules help us more easily understand each other.\n\n\nRecommended Grammar for Reports\n\nGrammar is more than just understanding how to avoid mistakes. It is necessary so that one can become a skilled writer and speaker. An effective police officer should have grasp of the basic components of English grammar so as to make reports free from mistakes. Remember, mistakes in your report could mean the dismissal of your case or even a case against you.\n\n\nFundamental Elements of Grammar\n\nThe following is a brief review of the different parts of speech.\n\n\nNouns\n\nA noun (Latin nomen, “name”) is a word that is used to identify anything that can be named or tells you what is being talked about.\n\n\nPronouns\n\nThese are identifying words used instead of a noun, i.e. substitutes for nouns.\n\n\nVerbs\n\nA verb connotes an action, state, or occurrence. It forms the main part of the predicate of a sentence.\n\nVerb Tenses\n\n\nAdjectives\n\nAn adjective is any word that describes a noun or pronoun.\n\n\nArticles\n\nArticles help us understand how specific a noun is.\n\n\nAdverbs\n\nAdverbs describe verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.\n\n\nPrepositions\n\nA preposition is a word that describes the relationship between two words in space.\n\n\nSubject-Verb Agreement\n\nSubjects and Predicates\n\nA subject is a person, place, idea, or thing described, discussed, or otherwise dealt with in a sentence. It can be a noun or pronoun together with all of the modifiers that tag along with it and it can be found at the beginning, middle, or end of a sentence.\n\nTo complete a sentence, every verb must have a subject. A verb that expresses an action has a who or what subject. Not all verbs are action verbs because they can be linking or helping verbs which connect the subject to something that refers to the subject.\n\nSubject-Verb Agreement\n\nThis refers to the matching in number of the subject and the verb. In other words, they have to agree whether they have to be in plural or singular form.\n\n\nWriting Clearly and Logically\n\nEffective police reports must be informative, clear, organized, and logical. It must also present all relevant information in the simplest manner that is understandable to the reader.\n\nParagraphs\n\nThese are the structural units for grouping information. Regardless of whether the investigation report is written in a narrative style or a category style, all paragraphs must be clear and easy to understand. Each paragraph’s first statement (lead-in statement) should clearly describe the paragraph’s main topic or issue. Within the paragraph, the lines should contain facts, ideas, justifications, or examples that are directly related to the main theme.\n\nTransitions\n\nThese connect different ideas, sentences, or paragraphs. Writers can assist their readers through the narrative by using the appropriate transitional words or phrases throughout the report.\n\nThe following are some examples of transitions. They are grouped according to type.\n\nTime\n\n * immediately\n * when\n * in the meantime\n * before\n * at the same time\n * prior to\n\nExample: Jimenez said he noticed that the door was not completely shut, so he decided to find out why. Immediately after entering the room, he saw that the window was broken.\n\nPlace\n\n * near\n * under\n * beyond\n * behind\n * next to\n * around\n\nExample: Jimenez said he saw broken glass on the floor under the window. Near the glass, he saw a large brick.\n\nOrder\n\n * finally\n * first\n * in addition\n * then\n * lastly\n * further\n\nExample: In addition, Jimenez saw his laptop was not on the desk where he left it the night before.\n\nConcrete vs Abstract Words\n\nAs already mentioned, reports should be written as simple as possible. As such, the use of abstract words or phrases is not encouraged. Instead, a report writer must use concrete words that clearly relay information and address relevant questions.\n\nHomonyms\n\nThese are words that sound similar, but have different meanings. It is important to ensure that the correct words are being used in every sentence, so this is something to watch out for.\n\nExample:\n\nWords: accept vs except\n\nDefinitions:\n\n * accept means to take with approval or agree to\n * except means to omit or exclude; it can also be used as a preposition to mean “but”\n\nExample sentences:\n\n * I accepted the medal with pride.\n * We did everything except interview the witnesses.\n\n\nProofreading\n\nThis is the process of reviewing a report for accuracy, clarity, and completeness. It is a rather difficult skill to learn, but it cannot be overlooked.\n\nWhen proofreading, special care should be taken to ensure that the following basic questions are answered\n\n * Are the correct crimes cited in the report?\n * Is the information in the proper order?\n * Are all crime elements articulated?\n * Based on the officer’s field notes, are the facts of the case correct?\n * Is the report well-organized?\n * Are all necessary information included?\n * Are things said efficiently or too wordy?\n * Are all conclusions supported by facts?\n * Are there any gaps in logic?\n * Are the names spelled correctly?\n\n\nMechanics of Proofreading\n\nA report’s effectiveness and a reporter’s credibility can be damaged by a report with too many mechanical errors.\n\nWhen proofreading a written report, it is important to look for the following:\n\n * inappropriate use of nouns, pronouns, verbs, etc.\n * vague or confusing language\n * incorrect or inappropriate use of words\n * gaps in logic or narrative flow\n * spelling errors\n * inappropriate punctuation\n * incorrect use of police, fire, or EMS abbreviations\n * overuse of words, such as “that”\n\nRemember that the above points are only guidelines. It does not necessarily mean that your checks end at these guide questions and statements.\n\n\nSupplemental Resources\n\nVideo Playlist: YouTube, Grammar – Khan Academy\n\nFree Online Course: Khan Academy, Grammar\n\n← Course Home Page\n\nChapter 2: Written Office Communications →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-te_1-2-2.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-11 14:54:47","updated_at":"2024-11-11 15:59:33","published_at":"2024-07-02 10:01:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67321b5b6bf85713393109e0","uuid":"e9a98eaf-fc7f-4fa4-93f2-cbee58a716e5","title":"Written Office Communications","slug":"written-office-communications","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Office communications are an essential part of any professional environment, and developing strong written communication skills early on will give you an edge in your career.

One of the most common forms of office communication is the memo, a tool designed to distribute information efficiently within an organization.\n\n\nWhat is a Memo?\n\nA memo, short for \"memorandum\" (from the Latin term memorandum est, meaning “to be remembered”), is a concise document used to share key information within a company. While memos can vary in formality depending on the organization, they are generally less formal than letters.\n\nThe term \"memo\" is widely accepted, but in highly formal situations, you may encounter the longer form, memorandum. The plural can be either memoranda or memorandums, both of which are correct.\n\n\nPurpose of Memos\n\nMemos are primarily created to communicate important information to relevant personnel. They are particularly useful when emails or instant messages won’t suffice, for example, when official documentation or signatures are required.\n\nAlthough memos are often short, some can be more detailed, especially when they function as report memos. These longer memos contain more in-depth information but still maintain a clear and concise format.\n\nIn summary, memos serve to:\n\n * Inform readers\n * Persuade others to take action\n * Provide feedback\n * Respond to specific situations\n\nCommon scenarios where memos are used include:\n\n * General Information Sharing: Announcements or updates within an organization.\n * Policy Changes: Informing staff of new or updated guidelines.\n * Instructions and Directives: Providing clear instructions for tasks or responsibilities.\n * Decision-Making: Communicating decisions made by leadership.\n * Coordination and Collaboration: Requesting feedback or coordinating tasks across teams.\n\nMemos are most often used for straightforward purposes like notifying staff about meeting times, deadlines, or other basic organizational details.\n\n\nTypes of Memos\n\nHere are some general types of memos you might encounter:\n\n * Directive Memo: Outlines policies or procedures.\n * Trip Report Memo: Summarizes the details of a business trip, including purpose, discussion, and action.\n * Request Memo: Asks for information or action from the recipient.\n * Response Memo: Provides answers or information in response to a request.\n * Report Memo: Summarizes the results or findings of a task.\n * Field Report Memo: Details the outcomes of inspections or procedures.\n * Confirmation Memo: Confirms decisions or responses to invitations.\n * Suggestive Memo: Shares ideas or opinions for consideration.\n\nThere are also specific business memos such as:\n\n * Operational Memo\n * Environmental Memo\n * Form Memo\n * Dress Code Memo\n * Financial Memo\n * Cover Memo\n\n\nFormat\n\nWhile the format of memos can vary slightly between organizations, the general structure remains consistent:\n\n * Paragraphs are single-spaced with double-spacing between them.\n * Indentations are not used.\n * Memos typically don’t include a signature, though names or initials may appear in the header.\n * Ideally, a memo fits onto a single page.\n * Bullet points can be used but should be limited.\n\nOptional lines, like CC or BCC, may be included if needed. The RE line can be used in place of a subject line.\n\n\nParts of a Memo\n\nThe essential parts of a memo are as follows:\n\n * Heading: Includes TO (recipient’s name and title), CC (others receiving a copy), FROM (sender’s name and title), DATE (written in full), and SUBJECT (topic).\n * Opening: Provides context, task, and purpose.\n * Summary: Brief overview of the memo’s content.\n * Discussion: Main content or body of the memo.\n * Closing: A final action or statement.\n * Attachments: Mentions any additional documents.\n\n\nOrganization\n\nThere are two main organizational styles for memos:\n\n 1. Direct Approach: Presents the purpose right at the start, followed by supporting details. This works well for routine or positive messages.\n 2. Indirect Approach: Begins with attention-grabbing details and presents the purpose later. This style suits persuasive or bad news messages.\n\nRegardless of the approach, memos should always end with a clear call to action or a courteous closing statement.\n\n\nStyle and Tone\n\nMemos are written in a professional tone, but the level of formality depends on the type of memo. Policy or report memos tend to be more formal, while standard memos may adopt a more conversational tone.\n\nAlways keep your audience in mind when writing a memo. Since most recipients will be your colleagues or supervisors, maintain a tone that is respectful, professional, and appropriate to the situation.\n\nThe tone of the memo should also match the technical expertise and authority level of the readers.\n\n\nLength\n\nMemos are typically short, ideally confined to a single page. However, this isn’t a strict rule, especially for report memos that may need to be longer. Remember that clarity and brevity are key—if a memo becomes too lengthy or complex, consider breaking it up or reassessing the content to keep it focused.\n\n\nCrafting an Effective Memo\n\nTo write an effective memo:\n\n * Start with a Heading: Include the organization's name and the word \"Memorandum\" or \"Office Memorandum.\"\n * Address the Recipients: List the individuals or departments receiving the memo.\n * Create a Clear Subject Line: Summarize the memo’s content concisely.\n * Write the Body: Use straightforward language, organizing information into paragraphs or bullet points for clarity.\n * Maintain a Professional Tone: Keep the language respectful and direct.\n * Include Relevant Details: Mention important dates, deadlines, and other critical information.\n * Format Properly: Use headings or bullet points to make the memo easy to read.\n * Mention Attachments: Reference any documents attached to the memo.\n * Include a Distribution List: Make sure all necessary recipients are listed.\n * Sign or Initial: To indicate your authority or approval, include your initials or signature at the end.\n\n← Chapter 1: Review on English Grammar\n\nChapter 3: Correspondence Etiquette →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-te_1-2-3.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-11 14:57:31","updated_at":"2024-11-11 15:59:51","published_at":"2024-07-02 10:02:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67321be76bf85713393109ee","uuid":"db967c95-0df4-4eae-8078-69332616a127","title":"Correspondence Etiquette","slug":"correspondence-etiquette","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Correspondence etiquette refers to the guidelines and standards that shape how we communicate through written forms, such as letters, emails, or messages.

These codes improve communication by allowing officers to express complex information with just a few numbers, helping them coordinate their efforts during emergencies and routine operations alike.</p><p>Some common 10-codes include:</p><ul><li><strong>10-4</strong>: Acknowledgment (message received)</li><li><strong>10-20</strong>: Location request (“What is your location?”)</li><li><strong>10-33</strong>: Emergency situation (all units stand by)</li></ul><h3 id=\"importance-of-police-radio-codes\">Importance of Police Radio Codes</h3><p>Using radio codes is critical for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Efficiency</strong><br>Codes are faster than using full sentences, allowing officers to communicate urgent information in a fraction of the time. For example, “10-33” communicates an emergency far faster than saying “Emergency, all units stand by.”</li><li><strong>Confidentiality</strong><br>By using codes, police can keep certain aspects of their communication unclear to the general public, protecting the integrity of their operations. Criminals are less likely to understand coded information, adding a layer of security.</li><li><strong>Precision</strong><br>Each radio code carries a specific meaning, reducing the likelihood of misunderstanding. Precise communication is vital, especially during critical incidents.</li></ul><p>However, it’s important to note that some law enforcement agencies are moving towards plain language communication. This shift aims to ensure that everyone, including agencies without training in 10-codes, can understand and respond appropriately during joint operations.</p><h3 id=\"ten-codes\">Ten Codes</h3>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table style=\"box-sizing: inherit;

These codes improve communication by allowing officers to express complex information with just a few numbers, helping them coordinate their efforts during emergencies and routine operations alike.\n\nSome common 10-codes include:\n\n * 10-4: Acknowledgment (message received)\n * 10-20: Location request (“What is your location?”)\n * 10-33: Emergency situation (all units stand by)\n\n\nImportance of Police Radio Codes\n\nUsing radio codes is critical for the following reasons:\n\n * Efficiency\n   Codes are faster than using full sentences, allowing officers to communicate urgent information in a fraction of the time. For example, “10-33” communicates an emergency far faster than saying “Emergency, all units stand by.”\n * Confidentiality\n   By using codes, police can keep certain aspects of their communication unclear to the general public, protecting the integrity of their operations. Criminals are less likely to understand coded information, adding a layer of security.\n * Precision\n   Each radio code carries a specific meaning, reducing the likelihood of misunderstanding. Precise communication is vital, especially during critical incidents.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that some law enforcement agencies are moving towards plain language communication. This shift aims to ensure that everyone, including agencies without training in 10-codes, can understand and respond appropriately during joint operations.\n\n\nTen Codes\n\n\n\nCodeMeaning10-0Caution10-1Unable to copy — change location10-2Signal good10-3Stop transmitting10-4Acknowledgement (OK)10-5Relay10-6Busy — stand by unless urgent10-7Out of service10-8In service10-9Repeat10-10Fight in progress10-11Dog case10-12Stand by (stop)10-13Weather — road report10-14Prowler report10-15Civil disturbance10-16Domestic disturbance10-17Meet complainant10-18Quickly10-19Return to …10-20Location10-21Call … by telephone10-22Disregard10-23Arrived at scene10-24Assignment completed10-25Report in person (meet) …10-26Detaining subject, expedite10-27Driver’s license information10-28Vehicle registration information10-29Check for wanted10-30Unnecessary use of radio10-31Crime in progress10-32Person with gun10-33Emergency10-34Riot10-35Major crime alert10-36Correct time10-37(Investigate) suspicious vehicle10-38Stopping suspicious vehicle10-39Urgent — use light, siren10-40Silent run — no light, siren10-41Beginning tour of duty10-42Ending tour of duty10-43Information10-44Permission to leave … for …10-45Animal carcass at …10-46Assist motorist10-47Emergency road repairs at …10-48Traffic standard repair at …10-49Traffic light out at …10-50Accident (fatal, personal injury, property damage)10-51Wrecker needed10-52Ambulance needed10-53Road blocked at …10-54Livestock on highway10-55Suspected DUI10-56Intoxicated pedestrian10-57Hit and run (fatal, personal injury, property damage)10-58Direct traffic10-59Convoy or escort10-60Squad in vicinity10-61Isolate self for message10-62Reply to message10-63Prepare to make written copy10-64Message for local delivery10-65Net message assignment10-66Message cancellation10-67Clear for net message10-68Dispatch information10-69Message received10-70Fire10-71Advise nature of fire10-72Report progress on fire10-73Smoke report10-74Negative10-75In contact with …10-76En route …10-77ETA (estimated time of arrival)10-78Need assistance10-79Notify coroner10-80Chase in progress10-81Breathalyzer10-82Reserve lodging10-83Work school xing at …10-84If meeting … advise ETA10-85Delayed due to …10-86Officer/operator on duty10-87Pick up/distribute checks10-88Present telephone number of …10-89Bomb threat10-90Bank alarm at …10-91Pick up prisoner/subject10-92Improperly parked vehicle10-93Blockade10-94Drag racing10-95Prisoner/subject in custody10-96Mental subject10-97Check (test) signal10-98Prison/jail break10-99Wanted/stolen indicated\n\n\n\nOfficial Ten-Code List from the Association of Public Communications Officers\n\n\nPhonetic Alphabet\n\nThe phonetic alphabet is another key tool used by law enforcement officers to communicate letters and numbers clearly over the radio. It consists of a set of standardized words assigned to each letter of the alphabet. For example, instead of saying “B” which may be misheard as “D,” an officer would say “Bravo.”\n\nExample of the NATO Phonetic Alphabet:\n\n * A: Alfa\n * B: Bravo\n * C: Charlie\n * D: Delta\n * E: Echo\n\n\nImportance of the Phonetic Alphabet\n\n * Clarity in Communication\n   Radios can sometimes produce poor sound quality, and in chaotic environments, it’s easy for single letters to be misheard. The phonetic alphabet eliminates this risk by ensuring each letter is pronounced in a way that minimizes confusion.\n * Precision in Reporting\n   Officers often need to communicate details like license plate numbers, street names, or suspect initials. Using phonetic words ensures these details are accurately conveyed and easily understood.\n * Standardized Communication\n   The NATO phonetic alphabet is internationally recognized, which means it provides a common language for police and security personnel regardless of their location or language background.\n * Security and Privacy\n   Similar to radio codes, using the phonetic alphabet helps officers share sensitive information discreetly. This prevents unauthorized individuals from easily deciphering law enforcement communications.\n * Avoiding Misunderstandings\n   Whether at a crowded event or in the middle of an emergency, clear communication can be challenging. The phonetic alphabet ensures that critical details like names and numbers are accurately transmitted, avoiding confusion that could lead to operational mistakes.\n\n\nNATO Phonetic Alphabet\n\n\n\nCharacterPhonicAAlfaBBravoCCharlieDDeltaEEchoFFoxtrotGGolfHHotelIIndiaJJuliettKKiloLLimaMMikeNNovemberOOscarPPapaQQuebecRRomeoSSeirraTTangoUUniformVVictorWWhiskeyXXrayYYankeeZZulu\n\n\n\nNATO Phonetic Alphabet\n\n\nCommon Use of Radio Codes and Phonetics\n\n * Traffic Stops\n   Officers often call in the license plate numbers of vehicles using the phonetic alphabet to ensure accuracy.\n * Incident Reports\n   During emergencies, officers use radio codes to quickly inform dispatch or other units of the situation.\n * Multi-Agency Operations\n   In situations where law enforcement agencies work together, both radio codes and the phonetic alphabet ensure standardized communication across different jurisdictions.\n\n← Chapter 4: Law Enforcement Agencies Correspondence\n\nChapter 6: Police Reports →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-te_1-2-6.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-11 15:03:43","updated_at":"2024-11-11 16:01:04","published_at":"2024-07-02 10:05:00","custom_excerpt":"Mastering radio codes and the phonetic alphabet is essential for clear, efficient, and secure communication in law enforcement operations.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67321e3e6bf8571339310a3b","uuid":"e860d328-2338-4d14-a445-e65575b8c8cd","title":"Police Reports","slug":"police-reports","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The core of any police report is the complete narrative of the incident that contains all the elements and details of the crime and written chronologically.

It is essential that the report writer is able to lay the legal foundations of the actions proceeding from the incident. The report must be able to show that the actions taken has been reasonable, that the legal rights of the culprits were not violated, and that there is probable cause to proceed with the case.</p><p>Basically, a police report is a blueprint that is used during trial of a case. Arguments brought up in court will be based on what has been written. Hence, it is essential that the report is able to convey pertinent information, such as physical evidence, collected and discovered during investigation.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-a-police-report\">What is a Police Report?</h2><p>A police report is a written narrative of the step-by-step or chronological sequence of an event that transpired in a given time, date and place. It is also defined as a written document prepared after a crime or incident is reported to police or any other law enforcement agency. It typically includes the following:</p><ul><li>names, status and addresses of the victims</li><li>names and addresses of witnesses</li><li>the classification and the elements of the offense</li><li>the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense</li><li>names, status and addresses of the suspects, should the identity be positively established; otherwise, their descriptions as provided by the victims and/or witnesses</li></ul><h3 id=\"purpose-of-the-police-report\">Purpose of the Police Report</h3><p>As mentioned above, the police report is essentially the&nbsp;<strong>blueprint&nbsp;</strong>of a case that it used during trial. Everything written in the report will be argued on or against by the lawyers involved in the case. An excellent police report could help in getting a conviction. Otherwise, the case could be thrown out after a defense lawyer successfully argues that a “clown” wrote the report.</p><p>Specifically, police reports are created for the following reasons:</p><ol><li>To serve as the community’s official document and permanent record of incidents</li><li>As data which could later be used in identifying community problems</li><li>To aid investigations, criminal prosecution, and court presentation</li><li>To help determine training requirements for police officers</li></ol><p>Furthermore, police reports are used:</p><ol><li>In the&nbsp;<strong>identification of criminals</strong>&nbsp;Since police reports contain details of a criminal incident, the details contained therein could be used in the future as reference for the identification of criminals. Specifically, when details such as name, physical descriptions, and unique characteristics are available, law enforcement can use this information to help find the people involved.</li><li>As&nbsp;<strong>investigation records</strong>&nbsp;As previously mentioned, police reports serve as the basis for many future related documents including progress reports on further investigations. These, in turn, help prosecutors, defense attorneys, and other law enforcement agencies because they get to have a source document for their needs.</li><li>For&nbsp;<strong>court preparation</strong>&nbsp;As a comprehensive document detailing a criminal incident, police officers can use their police reports to refresh their memory before their court appearances. This way, the statements they make during their testimonies will match with what was reported by others.</li><li>During&nbsp;<strong>civil liability assessmen</strong>t This is done when there is a need to compensate a person, especially a worker, for injuries suffered at work. Also, this assessment is done whenever there is a civil complaint against police officers. The basis for the assessment will be the details recorded in the police reports.</li><li>For&nbsp;<strong>statistical analysis</strong>&nbsp;Data in police reports can be used later in research, especially those that involve crime trends. The research can then be used to improve public policing policies and resources acquisition.</li></ol><h3 id=\"six-interrogatives-in-a-police-report\">Six Interrogatives in a Police Report</h3><p>As has already been mentioned, the 5W’s and 1H are important in report writing. Answering all these questions help the report writer create a comprehensive document that is able to provide useful and complete information.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/old.joanadvincula.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2.2.07-wwwwwh.jpg?resize=640%2C213&amp;ssl=1\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"213\"></figure><p><strong>Who</strong></p><p>The police report should&nbsp;<strong>include all the parties involved in the case</strong>. They must be identified by their complete names and personal circumstances, including aliases and their roles, e.g. suspect, victim, or witness.</p><p><strong>Do not use abbreviations.</strong>&nbsp;They might seem like this can save you time, but they might give the case a turn for the worse at court.</p><p><strong>Avoid the use of pronouns.&nbsp;</strong>Instead, use nouns whenever possible to keep the clearest picture of what took place and who did it.</p><p>Another part of the “who” in a report is being able to identify the mentioned persons and find them again. As such, the report writer must obtain the phone numbers and addresses for both the home and place of work, date of birth, ethnic origin, descriptions, occupation, and identifying numbers such as a driver’s license ID number.</p><p>“Who” should also include the property owner of the location of the incident, who took the victims or suspects to the hospital, who treated the injured, and who can describe them in court.</p><p><strong>What</strong></p><p>The “what” question leads to the heart of the crime. This is where the police officer should include the elements of the crime and the&nbsp;<em>modus operandi</em>. All the “what” relevant to the crime should be included in the report, especially the “what happened.”</p><p>Details of the “what” should be included, such as the elements of the crime positively identified and all the relevant descriptions for future reference. Statements made by the relevant parties should also be included.</p><p>When a particular action involves the violation of special laws, the police officer would do well to make sure that all the elements of the crime are documented and that the suspect is charged with each offense, whether it is a violation of the penal code, special laws, or even local ordinances.</p><p>Some questions that may be answered during the report writing could be:&nbsp;<em>What damages or injuries occurred as a result? What clothing was the suspect wearing? What exactly did he say and what did he do? Did he have particular speech patterns or physical abnormalities? What type of business or property was involved? What did the suspect use for transportation?</em></p><p>Of course, depending on your case, your questions will vary and will not always include the examples above.</p><p><strong>When</strong></p><p>Details about the time is incredibly important in any case brought into court. Hence, it should be written down as carefully and as accurately as possible.</p><p>This detail could make or break a case as it enables the prosecution to show how an incident could have possibly happened and eliminate alibis. If there is a major discrepancy in the times and dates stated in the report, the case could be dismissed or turned right out of court.</p><p>For future law enforcement purposes, careful noting of this detail can help in crime prevention as it could help law enforcement officers establish crime patterns in their jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>Where</strong></p><p>The police report should describe in detail where exactly a crime took place. This is a critical piece of information when determining the legal jurisdiction of the court, as well as the area of responsibilities of the law enforcement agencies involved.</p><p>The information about the location should be as detailed as possible, i.e. it should include the number, street, barangay, city or municipality, province must be indicated. It must also be noted whether it is a residential or business place.</p><p>For robberies and similar crimes, the point of entry has to be described. For traffic accident reports, the point of impact must be located.</p><p><strong>Why</strong></p><p>Basically:&nbsp;<em>Why did the crime take place?</em></p><p>This might be the most difficult question to answer as this goes into the core of the crime. Without a completed investigation and/or a confession from the perpetrator, a police officer can only make proposals or suggestions on why the crime happened.</p><p>It might be a simple question, but it could show the motive of the suspect and establish his state of mind. From there, the investigators could then fully establish the elements of the crime and/or any circumstances relative to the incident.</p><p><strong>How</strong></p><p>This question answers the part of the “modus operandi” requirement of the report. Information on the exact steps taken by the perpetrator to commit the crime are described here. For instance:&nbsp;<em>How did the suspect approach the scene of the crime? How did the suspect use his weapons? How did the suspect announce his demands?</em></p><p>Additionally, there is a need to indicate the “how’s” pertaining to the information gathered. That is, how did the police officer manage to get hold of the information being reported. For example, a report on a robbery could state:&nbsp;<em>Investigation conducted discovered that the suspect entered through the unlocked kitchen door.</em>&nbsp;Through this, the report writer discloses how the information was obtained and, at the same time, show the court that the information was not obtained illegally.</p><h2 id=\"use-of-notes-in-a-police-report\">Use of Notes in a Police Report</h2><p>Many police reports begin with written notes. They are often taken down in a pocket-sized notebook, often called a “tickler.” No one’s memory is perfect, not even trained police officers. So, a notebook is most helpful in ensuring that the police officer can have accurate information regarding the facts of the case.</p><p>At the beginning of an officer’s career, they may find during report writing that they have written so much trivial information in their notes that they ended up missing important details. With experience, the police officer improves their notes and starts including more information that are relevant to the case.</p><p>Field notes do have a limited value in court as evidence. Nevertheless, it would not hurt to save field notes for future reference.</p><h3 id=\"field-notes\">Field Notes</h3><p>These are notes that the officer creates while on the line of duty; for instance, while on patrol or during the conduct of interviews.</p><p>Every incident is unique. As such, the information needed by any officer when writing a report would vary for each individual case. This is where field notes would come in handy. As much as possible, the notes should answer the 5W’s and 1H of the incident.</p><p>The following table should serve as a guide regarding the details that should be included in the field notes for different types of subjects:</p>\n<!--kg-card-begin: html-->\n<table style=\"box-sizing: inherit;

Additionally, it reduces the possibility of the witness testimony being manipulated by others.</li><li><strong>Establish rapport</strong><br>Be polite, considerate, and patient. Briefly explain why the interview is necessary as well as the interview procedure.</li><li><strong>Listen attentively</strong><br>Ask the person about the incident and allow them to speak freely about it. Make sure that their attention is focused on the main topic of the interview. If they begin to stray from the topic, gently steer them back, and constantly use active listening skills to motivate them to speak further. Remember to pay close attention to every detail being narrated.</li><li><strong>Take notes, ask questions</strong><br>Request that the subject repeat their narrative, but, this time, interrupt when clarifications are necessary. Take notes, but keep them brief and basic, underlining the most important thoughts or ideas.

It is used in, but not limited to, the following:</p><ul><li>the first word of a sentence</li><li>proper nouns and adjectives derived from proper nouns</li><li>the names of the days of the week, month, holidays and religious days</li><li>common organizational terms</li></ul><p>Depending on the content of the report and the nature of the case, other types of words might still require capitalization, so do not be careless in your writing.</p><p><strong>Number Expression</strong></p><p>In general, numbers zero through ten are spelled out while anything above ten is written as figures. Figures are also used in the following:</p><ul><li>dates</li><li>all numbers, if two or more related numbers are used in the same sentence</li><li>measurements, such as time, money, distance and weight</li><li>percentages</li><li>mixed numbers</li></ul><p>However, note that numbers used as a first word of a sentence must be spelled out along with the shorter of two adjacent numbers and the words million and billion in even amounts.</p><p>Additionally, decimals must not be used with even amounts and fractions.</p><p><strong>Abbreviations</strong></p><p>As previously mentioned, abbreviations must be avoided as much as possible. Do not abbreviate the following:</p><ul><li>common words such as&nbsp;<em>department&nbsp;</em>(i.e. as&nbsp;<em>dept.</em>) or&nbsp;<em>organization&nbsp;</em>(i.e. as&nbsp;<em>org</em>)</li><li>compass points</li><li>units or measure</li><li>names of the days of the week nor the months in the year</li><li>cities or provinces</li></ul><p>On forms and in tables, units of measure may be abbreviated if they occur frequently, but should not use periods, i.e. use “<em>cm</em>” instead of “<em>cm.</em>” when the relevant measure is in centimeters.</p><p>When writing initials, use a period after each letter but do not add internal spaces. For all-capital abbreviations on the other hand, do not use periods nor internal spaces.</p><p><strong>Punctuation</strong></p><p>The following is a refresher on how to properly use some of the different types of punctuation marks.</p><ol><li><strong>Apostrophe ‘&nbsp;</strong>Used to show connections of one or more letters, one or more words or figures in a number, show possession, and to

statement, after the salutation of a business letter, to separate the hours from minutes when indicating time, and to separate parts of a citation</li><li><strong>Comma ,&nbsp;</strong>Used to separate the day of the month when indicating the date, to set off words or phrases that suggest a break in thought, to set off first, second, no, yes and other similar words when they introduce a sentence, to set up groups of digits in large numbers, to separate unrelated numbers in a sentence, to set off words that explain or define other words, to set off phrases and dependent clauses that add to the main thoughts of a sentence but are not essential to it, to separate long coordinate clauses of compound sentences, to set off coordinate phrases modifying the same noun, between parts of a sentence that suggest contrast or comparison, to indicate omission of one or two words, to separate identical or similar words in a sentence, and to separate adjacent words that might mistakenly be joined when reading a sentence</li><li><strong>Dash –&nbsp;</strong>Used in place of or between numbers or dates, before a summarizing statement introduced by&nbsp;<em>all</em>,&nbsp;<em>this</em>, or similar words, before a repeated word or expression, to emphasize or define a start of a sentence, to indicate an aside or a point of view of the speaker, to suggest halting or hesitant speech, and to

It is essential that the report writer is able to lay the legal foundations of the actions proceeding from the incident. The report must be able to show that the actions taken has been reasonable, that the legal rights of the culprits were not violated, and that there is probable cause to proceed with the case.\n\nBasically, a police report is a blueprint that is used during trial of a case. Arguments brought up in court will be based on what has been written. Hence, it is essential that the report is able to convey pertinent information, such as physical evidence, collected and discovered during investigation.\n\n\nWhat is a Police Report?\n\nA police report is a written narrative of the step-by-step or chronological sequence of an event that transpired in a given time, date and place. It is also defined as a written document prepared after a crime or incident is reported to police or any other law enforcement agency. It typically includes the following:\n\n * names, status and addresses of the victims\n * names and addresses of witnesses\n * the classification and the elements of the offense\n * the facts and circumstances surrounding the offense\n * names, status and addresses of the suspects, should the identity be positively established; otherwise, their descriptions as provided by the victims and/or witnesses\n\n\nPurpose of the Police Report\n\nAs mentioned above, the police report is essentially the blueprint of a case that it used during trial. Everything written in the report will be argued on or against by the lawyers involved in the case. An excellent police report could help in getting a conviction. Otherwise, the case could be thrown out after a defense lawyer successfully argues that a “clown” wrote the report.\n\nSpecifically, police reports are created for the following reasons:\n\n 1. To serve as the community’s official document and permanent record of incidents\n 2. As data which could later be used in identifying community problems\n 3. To aid investigations, criminal prosecution, and court presentation\n 4. To help determine training requirements for police officers\n\nFurthermore, police reports are used:\n\n 1. In the identification of criminals Since police reports contain details of a criminal incident, the details contained therein could be used in the future as reference for the identification of criminals. Specifically, when details such as name, physical descriptions, and unique characteristics are available, law enforcement can use this information to help find the people involved.\n 2. As investigation records As previously mentioned, police reports serve as the basis for many future related documents including progress reports on further investigations. These, in turn, help prosecutors, defense attorneys, and other law enforcement agencies because they get to have a source document for their needs.\n 3. For court preparation As a comprehensive document detailing a criminal incident, police officers can use their police reports to refresh their memory before their court appearances. This way, the statements they make during their testimonies will match with what was reported by others.\n 4. During civil liability assessment This is done when there is a need to compensate a person, especially a worker, for injuries suffered at work. Also, this assessment is done whenever there is a civil complaint against police officers. The basis for the assessment will be the details recorded in the police reports.\n 5. For statistical analysis Data in police reports can be used later in research, especially those that involve crime trends. The research can then be used to improve public policing policies and resources acquisition.\n\n\nSix Interrogatives in a Police Report\n\nAs has already been mentioned, the 5W’s and 1H are important in report writing. Answering all these questions help the report writer create a comprehensive document that is able to provide useful and complete information.\n\nWho\n\nThe police report should include all the parties involved in the case. They must be identified by their complete names and personal circumstances, including aliases and their roles, e.g. suspect, victim, or witness.\n\nDo not use abbreviations. They might seem like this can save you time, but they might give the case a turn for the worse at court.\n\nAvoid the use of pronouns. Instead, use nouns whenever possible to keep the clearest picture of what took place and who did it.\n\nAnother part of the “who” in a report is being able to identify the mentioned persons and find them again. As such, the report writer must obtain the phone numbers and addresses for both the home and place of work, date of birth, ethnic origin, descriptions, occupation, and identifying numbers such as a driver’s license ID number.\n\n“Who” should also include the property owner of the location of the incident, who took the victims or suspects to the hospital, who treated the injured, and who can describe them in court.\n\nWhat\n\nThe “what” question leads to the heart of the crime. This is where the police officer should include the elements of the crime and the modus operandi. All the “what” relevant to the crime should be included in the report, especially the “what happened.”\n\nDetails of the “what” should be included, such as the elements of the crime positively identified and all the relevant descriptions for future reference. Statements made by the relevant parties should also be included.\n\nWhen a particular action involves the violation of special laws, the police officer would do well to make sure that all the elements of the crime are documented and that the suspect is charged with each offense, whether it is a violation of the penal code, special laws, or even local ordinances.\n\nSome questions that may be answered during the report writing could be: What damages or injuries occurred as a result? What clothing was the suspect wearing? What exactly did he say and what did he do? Did he have particular speech patterns or physical abnormalities? What type of business or property was involved? What did the suspect use for transportation?\n\nOf course, depending on your case, your questions will vary and will not always include the examples above.\n\nWhen\n\nDetails about the time is incredibly important in any case brought into court. Hence, it should be written down as carefully and as accurately as possible.\n\nThis detail could make or break a case as it enables the prosecution to show how an incident could have possibly happened and eliminate alibis. If there is a major discrepancy in the times and dates stated in the report, the case could be dismissed or turned right out of court.\n\nFor future law enforcement purposes, careful noting of this detail can help in crime prevention as it could help law enforcement officers establish crime patterns in their jurisdictions.\n\nWhere\n\nThe police report should describe in detail where exactly a crime took place. This is a critical piece of information when determining the legal jurisdiction of the court, as well as the area of responsibilities of the law enforcement agencies involved.\n\nThe information about the location should be as detailed as possible, i.e. it should include the number, street, barangay, city or municipality, province must be indicated. It must also be noted whether it is a residential or business place.\n\nFor robberies and similar crimes, the point of entry has to be described. For traffic accident reports, the point of impact must be located.\n\nWhy\n\nBasically: Why did the crime take place?\n\nThis might be the most difficult question to answer as this goes into the core of the crime. Without a completed investigation and/or a confession from the perpetrator, a police officer can only make proposals or suggestions on why the crime happened.\n\nIt might be a simple question, but it could show the motive of the suspect and establish his state of mind. From there, the investigators could then fully establish the elements of the crime and/or any circumstances relative to the incident.\n\nHow\n\nThis question answers the part of the “modus operandi” requirement of the report. Information on the exact steps taken by the perpetrator to commit the crime are described here. For instance: How did the suspect approach the scene of the crime? How did the suspect use his weapons? How did the suspect announce his demands?\n\nAdditionally, there is a need to indicate the “how’s” pertaining to the information gathered. That is, how did the police officer manage to get hold of the information being reported. For example, a report on a robbery could state: Investigation conducted discovered that the suspect entered through the unlocked kitchen door. Through this, the report writer discloses how the information was obtained and, at the same time, show the court that the information was not obtained illegally.\n\n\nUse of Notes in a Police Report\n\nMany police reports begin with written notes. They are often taken down in a pocket-sized notebook, often called a “tickler.” No one’s memory is perfect, not even trained police officers. So, a notebook is most helpful in ensuring that the police officer can have accurate information regarding the facts of the case.\n\nAt the beginning of an officer’s career, they may find during report writing that they have written so much trivial information in their notes that they ended up missing important details. With experience, the police officer improves their notes and starts including more information that are relevant to the case.\n\nField notes do have a limited value in court as evidence. Nevertheless, it would not hurt to save field notes for future reference.\n\n\nField Notes\n\nThese are notes that the officer creates while on the line of duty; for instance, while on patrol or during the conduct of interviews.\n\nEvery incident is unique. As such, the information needed by any officer when writing a report would vary for each individual case. This is where field notes would come in handy. As much as possible, the notes should answer the 5W’s and 1H of the incident.\n\nThe following table should serve as a guide regarding the details that should be included in the field notes for different types of subjects:\n\n\n\nSubjectBasic InformationAdditional InformationVictims and Witnessesfull name, age, date of birth, race, sex, phone numbers, address/es, email address/esbest way to contact, best place to contact, best time to contact, details on the place of employmentOccurencetype of crime, location, date and time of incident, identity of the person who handled the physical evidence found, disposition and chain of custody of all evidence, suspect direction of travel, type and description of weapons, threats made with weapons, direct statements made by the suspect, case number, assisting officer’s actionsinformants, reporting party, victims, witnesses, suspects, officers, outside agencies and members of outside agencies involved, medical personnel, members of the mediaSuspectsrace, sex, age, build, height, weight, eye color, hair color, hairstyle, facial hair, clothing type, clothing color, clothing style, name or street name, unusual physical attributes, whether the subject can be identified by the witness/esunusual or memorable gestures, speech peculiarities, jewelry, handedness, gang affiliation/sIncident Specificscene description, point of entry, point of exit, description of property damage, types and values of property taken, nature and location of evidence collected, suspect and victim injuries, unique characteristics of the crimeanything else not already mentioned that the officer believes is relevant to the case\n\n\n\nRemember that these are meant to serve as a guide only and not an exhaustive list of all information that could be included in the field notes.\n\n\nField Interviews\n\nThese are interviews done in the line of duty.\n\nAn effective field interview generally follows this five-step format:\n\n 1. Separate the involved parties\n    This helps reduce interruptions and distractions. Separating the parties also allows them to focus on speaking with the officer rather than each other. Additionally, it reduces the possibility of the witness testimony being manipulated by others.\n 2. Establish rapport\n    Be polite, considerate, and patient. Briefly explain why the interview is necessary as well as the interview procedure.\n 3. Listen attentively\n    Ask the person about the incident and allow them to speak freely about it. Make sure that their attention is focused on the main topic of the interview. If they begin to stray from the topic, gently steer them back, and constantly use active listening skills to motivate them to speak further. Remember to pay close attention to every detail being narrated.\n 4. Take notes, ask questions\n    Request that the subject repeat their narrative, but, this time, interrupt when clarifications are necessary. Take notes, but keep them brief and basic, underlining the most important thoughts or ideas. At this stage, make sure that you already have the subject’s correct identity information.\n 5. Verify information\n    Repeat certain details noted in the previous steps to the subject to ensure accuracy and give them the opportunity to add facts. Make sure to double check all gathered information and ensure verification of any modified information.\n\nBelow are some guide questions that could be used to help make an effective police report.\n\n\n\nQuestion TypeSupporting Facts/InformationWho?everyone involved: participating officers, complainant, discoverer, witnesses, persons of interest, suspects, associates, accomplices, accessories – along with the contact information, job details, and physical descriptions of these involved peopleWhat?nature of the crime, actions of the suspects before the commission of the crime, evidence obtained, actions related to the evidence collected, further action to be taken, other agencies involved, other agencies that need to be involvedWhen?specifics of the date and time of the incident, notification of the involved parties, arrival of the involved parties, last visual of the victim, arrival of the officers, arrests, unusual occurrences, crime was decidedWhere?locations relevant to the crime: the crime itself, entry point, exit point, evidence, victim, suspect, witnesses, residences of the involved parties, other relevant addresses, evidence storageWhy?\n(if known)reasons for: the commission of the crime, the weapons or tools used, reporting the incident, hesitance in giving information, date, time, and location of the crimeHow?commission of the crime, exit of the suspect, information of the victim obtained, discovery of the crime, entry of the suspect, crime objects obtained, arrest, damage\n\n\n\n\nFundamental Police Report Contents\n\nThe following content elements are essential towards an effective police report. However, we should always remember to only use this list as a guide since some elements may not be appropriate for certain types of cases.\n\n 1. Initial information how the officer became involved in the incident, relevant background information, officer’s early observations, actions taken upon arrival at the scene\n 2. Identification of the crime or incident all information necessary to prove that an incident happened, common name of the crime, statutory reference number, requisite essential elements of the crime\n 3. Identification of the involved parties information (if known) about the reporting individuals, victims, witnesses, suspects – names, addresses, and work and personal phone numbers of everyone involved, alternative contact details, email addresses, specific roles in the incident\n 4. Statements from victims, witnesses, and suspects summaries and direct quotes, the facts of the occurrence (from the point of view of the individuals involved)\n 5. Details about the crime scene crime scene specifics necessary to precisely recreate the scene, images and locations of physical evidence prior to collection (if possible), photographs should be printed for inclusion in the report and, if applicable, booked as property as proof\n 6. Information regarding properties involved exact or precise details about stolen or recovered property, also property booked for safekeeping and evidence – these should also be entered in the LETS (Law Enforcement Telecommunications Systems) if applicable\n 7. Actions and observations done by the officers detailed descriptions of all events that occurred during the incident; if more than one officer responded, each should submit a supplement detailing their own activities during the incident\n\n\nGeneral Types of Police Reports\n\n\nBasic or Informal Report\n\nThis deals with the ordinary, miscellaneous, usual, memorandum letter, or form accomplished by any member of a unit, section, bureau, or division within a department in accordance with prescribed regulation. Usually, this report contains the following:\n\n 1. The heading or letterhead of the unit where the writer is assigned;\n 2. The person or office to whom it is addressed or submitted;\n 3. The text proper; and,\n 4. The name of the writer or source of the report\n\n\nInvestigative or Formal Report\n\nThis covers an exhaustive and exact narration of facts. These are classified as:\n\n 1. Initial or Advanced Report An advanced account regarding a new case assigned to an investigator. It is written and submitted without delay after having conducted the initial investigation of the case.\n 2. Progress or Follow-up Report Contains the results of the follow-up investigation of a recent case. It is accomplished whenever any development relevant to the case is discovered. It serves as a gauge or yardstick for the detective’s efficiency.\n 3. Final or Closing Report It is a comprehensive narration of facts and details based on a thorough inquiry of the case by the detective who started the investigation covering all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. It forms a clear picture of the crime committed in the minds of the readers for prosecutorial and judicial actions. The final or closing report is undertaken whenever the case is solved and considered as closed, signifying that the offender has been arrested, the evidence against him is complete to warrant prosecution, and witnesses are located to testify for the trial.\n\n\nOther Types of Reports\n\n * Spot Report or Special Report Written immediately after an incident took place in a certain area. It must be done or acted upon within 24 hours\n * Beat Inspection/After Patrol Report Written after completing an inspection of an officer’s patrol area\n * Situation Report Completed on a case-by-case basis; contains the state of a specific incident or incidents that are of public concern; primarily addressed to the commander or leader in order for him to be aware of the current situation before the media and general public\n * Incident Report Prepared after a crime incident or accident is reported to police or law enforcement agencies.\n * Post-Operation Report May be rendered after any successful police operation\n * Status Report Describes the situation of the investigation at the present time\n * Investigation Report Details the findings of an investigation as soon as a formal complaint is filed or an incident occurs\n * Vertical and Lateral Reports A vertical report is meant to go upward or downward the hierarchy. A lateral report assists in organization and communication between groups that are at the same level of the hierarchy.\n * After Incident Report Generated after a particular incident, such as a crime, accident, or any event requiring police intervention. The purpose of the After Incident Report is to document the details and actions taken by law enforcement personnel following the incident.\n * Periodic or Evaluation Report An evaluation report is a paper that examines whether the process is working, according to a set of standards. It includes an introduction, background information, criteria, evaluation, conclusions, and recommendations.\n * Police Blotter Report A log book that keeps track of all crime incident; official summaries, reports, arrests, and other noteworthy events that occur in a police station are recorded in the blotter\n * After Operation Report written following a successful police operation that resulted in the arrest of one or more members of a syndicated crime group\n\n\nQualities of a Good Report\n\nFactual All details and information are based on the five human senses. The simplest words constructed in declarative and short sentences using the third person are all that is necessary.\n\nAccurate A report should only conform to the facts and be free from errors. Being accurate is being exact. All facts must be objectively verified. The identification of facts is imperative to establish the corpus delicti or the body of the crime in the report. You must restrict your report to the facts of the incident as you saw them or as victims and witnesses perceived and reported to you. You must accurately report the conditions of the scene as you have found them.\n\nClear The format and language used in the report must be as simple and as direct as possible.\n\nConcise The report should be brief in its expression. That is, saying much in as few words as possible. Conciseness relates to the elimination of unnecessary words. Some ways to do this when writing are using the active voice, avoiding wordiness, eliminating unnecessary prepositional phrases, and using ordinary and commonly understood words. Most sentences in police reports are 12 to 15 words only.\n\nComplete The report must contain all the facts and essential information revealed during the investigation.\n\nTimely Reports should be done within a timeframe that would not make it a hindrance to the progress of the case.\n\nFair and Objective The report must show all the angles and sides of the event. Emotion, opinion and personal prejudice should always be avoided.\n\n\nMechanics of a Police Report\n\nThe following mechanics of a police report are highly suggested:\n\nCapitalization\n\nRemember to use proper capitalization. It is used in, but not limited to, the following:\n\n * the first word of a sentence\n * proper nouns and adjectives derived from proper nouns\n * the names of the days of the week, month, holidays and religious days\n * common organizational terms\n\nDepending on the content of the report and the nature of the case, other types of words might still require capitalization, so do not be careless in your writing.\n\nNumber Expression\n\nIn general, numbers zero through ten are spelled out while anything above ten is written as figures. Figures are also used in the following:\n\n * dates\n * all numbers, if two or more related numbers are used in the same sentence\n * measurements, such as time, money, distance and weight\n * percentages\n * mixed numbers\n\nHowever, note that numbers used as a first word of a sentence must be spelled out along with the shorter of two adjacent numbers and the words million and billion in even amounts.\n\nAdditionally, decimals must not be used with even amounts and fractions.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nAs previously mentioned, abbreviations must be avoided as much as possible. Do not abbreviate the following:\n\n * common words such as department (i.e. as dept.) or organization (i.e. as org)\n * compass points\n * units or measure\n * names of the days of the week nor the months in the year\n * cities or provinces\n\nOn forms and in tables, units of measure may be abbreviated if they occur frequently, but should not use periods, i.e. use “cm” instead of “cm.” when the relevant measure is in centimeters.\n\nWhen writing initials, use a period after each letter but do not add internal spaces. For all-capital abbreviations on the other hand, do not use periods nor internal spaces.\n\nPunctuation\n\nThe following is a refresher on how to properly use some of the different types of punctuation marks.\n\n 1.  Apostrophe ‘ Used to show connections of one or more letters, one or more words or figures in a number, show possession, and to show plurals of numbers, letters and words discussed\n 2.  Brackets [ ] Used as parentheses within parentheses, to correct a mistake in a direct quote, to indicate explanation or one’s own comments without quotation\n 3.  Colon : Used after a statement followed by a list, after a statement followed by a clause that extends, explains or amplifies the statement, after the salutation of a business letter, to separate the hours from minutes when indicating time, and to separate parts of a citation\n 4.  Comma , Used to separate the day of the month when indicating the date, to set off words or phrases that suggest a break in thought, to set off first, second, no, yes and other similar words when they introduce a sentence, to set up groups of digits in large numbers, to separate unrelated numbers in a sentence, to set off words that explain or define other words, to set off phrases and dependent clauses that add to the main thoughts of a sentence but are not essential to it, to separate long coordinate clauses of compound sentences, to set off coordinate phrases modifying the same noun, between parts of a sentence that suggest contrast or comparison, to indicate omission of one or two words, to separate identical or similar words in a sentence, and to separate adjacent words that might mistakenly be joined when reading a sentence\n 5.  Dash – Used in place of or between numbers or dates, before a summarizing statement introduced by all, this, or similar words, before a repeated word or expression, to emphasize or define a start of a sentence, to indicate an aside or a point of view of the speaker, to suggest halting or hesitant speech, and to indicate a sudden break or interruption within a sentence\n 6.  Ellipses … Used within a quotation to indicate places where a word or words have been omitted and at the end of a quotation to indicate words omitted before the period\n 7.  Exclamation Point ! Used after a word, phrase or sentence that expresses strong or sudden feeling, to emphasize a command or strong points of view, and to show sarcasm, irony, or amusement\n 8.  Hyphen – Used to mark the division of a word at the end of a line, to join word parts, and to separate words\n 9.  Period . Used after a sentence, after a command given without emphasis, after initials, after an abbreviation or part of many abbreviations, and after each number or letter that begins a heading in an outline\n 10. Parentheses ( ) Used around explanatory material of a sentence when this material has no essential connection with the rest of the sentence, to enclose sources of information within a sentence around numbers, letters that indicate subdivision of a sentence, and around figures which repeat numbers written out\n 11. Question Mark ? Used after a direct question, after a statement followed by a question, after a word that indicates a question\n 12. Quotation Marks ” ” Used to indicate exact words of a speaker, around each part of a direct quotation when explaining words come between the parts, enclose quoted words or phrases within a sentence, around titles, around a word or phrase explained or defined by the rest of the sentence, and around a word to which attention is called\n 13. Semicolon ; Used between parts of a compound sentence when they are joined in by conjunctions, before a conjunction connecting independent clauses when either clause contains commas, after each clause in a series of three or more clauses\n 14. Underline Used in the name of any book or complete volume, the name of a magazine or periodicals, any foreign word that is not commonly used in English, and any word considered not for their grammatical meaning but as words\n 15. Virgule / Used as a dividing line in dates, fractions and abbreviations, when recording bibliographical information and to indicate the end of lines in a title or subtitle\n\n\nChecking the Police Report\n\nUpon completion, the report writer should carefully read the police report purposefully to check the following:\n\n * Elements of the Offense\n * Inherent Circumstances\n * Probable Cause\n * Specific Terminologies\n * Custodial Rights\n * Suspect’s Statement\n * Witness’s Statement\n * Grammar and Spelling\n\nIf any one of these are not done properly or reported correctly, the case could be dismissed before it could even get to court. Hence, it is vital that the report writer double-check all these important factors before submitting a report.\n\n\nPolice Blotter\n\nEach PNP operating unit shall maintain an official blotter where all types of operational and undercover dispatches shall be recorded containing the 5W’s and 1H of an information.\n\nA police blotter refers to the record of daily events occurring within the area of responsibility/territory/jurisdiction of a given police command or unit. It contains material facts and details concerning the event for legal purposes. It is an informational record book that is useful for investigation, evidentiary or referral purposes.\n\n\nContents of Police Blotter Entries\n\nPolice blotter entries should contain the following:\n\n * The 5 W’s and 1 H along with the disposition of the case\n * All material details pertaining to the event and the status of the case\n\nThe following transactions or incidents are entered in the police blotter:\n\n * Violations of ordinances and laws reported and/or discovered\n * All calls in which any member of the PNP is dispatched or takes official action\n * All fire alarms, reports and information received by the stations\n * Movement of detention prisoners with corresponding notations on the authority for such movement\n * Vehicular and other types of incidents which require police action\n * All injuries, bodies discovered, and suicides\n * Damage to property\n * All cases to which a member of the PNP is involved\n * All arrests and returns made\n * Miscellaneous cases\n\n\nGuidelines in Making the Entries\n\n * All entries in the police blotter shall be handwritten in a clear, concise and simple manner.\n * Only facts, not opinions, are entered into the blotter.\n * No erasures shall be made in the entries. Corrections are made by drawing one horizontal line over such word or phrases and the actual entry initiated by the police officer making the correction.\n * A pen with black or blue ink is used in making entries.\n * Falsification in the blotter or any attempt to suppress any information therein is criminally and administratively punishable.\n * The entries must be legibly written in long hand and consecutively numbered.\n * Every page of the blotter shall be uninterruptedly and chronologically filled-up. No line or space shall be left blank between two entries.\n * Any development of the case to be reflected in the blotter should be a new entry at the time and day it was reported. A reference to the previous entry number of the case shall be made.\n * In every shift, the Duty Sergeant, under the supervision of the Duty Officer, or Complaint Desk Officer shall make the actual entries in the blotter and, at the end of their tour, they shall sign the blotter.\n\n← Chapter 5: Radio Codes and Phonetics Used in Police Reports","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-te_1-2-7.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-11 15:09:50","updated_at":"2024-11-11 16:01:23","published_at":"2024-07-02 10:06:00","custom_excerpt":"A police report is a detailed, chronological account of an incident that serves as the legal foundation for investigation and prosecution.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67321ebc6bf8571339310a4b","uuid":"33946793-f8cf-4d06-9b89-3b2ab01bafd5","title":"Case Portfolio","slug":"case-portfolio-guidelines","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Your \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"case portfolio\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is a group project.

The color of the flame will change according to the materials burning and the environment in which the fire is happening. You can also deliberately change the color of the flame by adding different materials to the fire.\n\nLikewise, the intensity of any fire will change according to the materials and environment. For example, dry wood will burn hot and fast, but a fire in fresh wood could simply extinguish itself.\n\n\nElements of Fire\n\nFire is commonly represented in what is known as the fire triangle:\n\nAll three elements - heat, fuel, and oxygen - are necessary for a fire to happen.

In most cases, friction is used to produce heat to start a fire. For example, you strike the head of a matchstick against a prepared surface on the side of the matchbox.

It never moves in the other direction unless another form of energy is present during the transfer. The transfer will continue until&nbsp;<strong><em>thermal equilibrium</em></strong>&nbsp;is achieved.</p><p>This \"hotness\" or \"coldness\" is expressed as&nbsp;<strong>temperature</strong>. Technically speaking, the temperature of an object is&nbsp;<em>the average kinetic energy of the movement of its molecules</em>. Thermometers are used to measure temperature.</p><h3 id=\"ignition-temperature-or-ignition-energy\">Ignition Temperature or Ignition Energy</h3><p>Ignition temperature is the minimum temperature at which a substance can burn. A given material must be heated up to this temperature before ignition can begin. At this temperature, the material starts to release vapors which enables the combustion process to commence.</p><h3 id=\"sources-of-heat\">Sources of Heat</h3><p>Heat is an essential part of fires. Without heat, no fire can start. Heat must also be continually present in the fire for it to keep burning and spreading. There are four general types of heat sources:&nbsp;<em>mechanical</em>,&nbsp;<em>chemical</em>,&nbsp;<em>electrical</em>, and&nbsp;<em>nuclear</em>. Under each type are various sources that range from daily objects to unusual ones.</p><p>Investigators must be familiar with all of these heat sources to be able to understand fires.

In other words, heat is the flow of kinetic energy from one body to another.\n\nHeat always flows from a hotter body to a cooler one. It never moves in the other direction unless another form of energy is present during the transfer. The transfer will continue until thermal equilibrium is achieved.\n\nThis \"hotness\" or \"coldness\" is expressed as temperature. Technically speaking, the temperature of an object is the average kinetic energy of the movement of its molecules. Thermometers are used to measure temperature.\n\n\nIgnition Temperature or Ignition Energy\n\nIgnition temperature is the minimum temperature at which a substance can burn. A given material must be heated up to this temperature before ignition can begin. At this temperature, the material starts to release vapors which enables the combustion process to commence.\n\n\nSources of Heat\n\nHeat is an essential part of fires. Without heat, no fire can start. Heat must also be continually present in the fire for it to keep burning and spreading. There are four general types of heat sources: mechanical, chemical, electrical, and nuclear. Under each type are various sources that range from daily objects to unusual ones.\n\nInvestigators must be familiar with all of these heat sources to be able to understand fires. If your knowledge in this area is weak, you will be faced with more fire incidents than you can properly resolve.\n\nMechanical\n\nMechanical heat comes from friction which is a type of force that resists motion. Commonly, we observe this in two objects rubbing against each other. Friction by itself does not automatically cause a fire. Different factors, including the properties of the materials and the nature of the motion generating the heat, should be considered.\n\nChemical\n\nThis is heat that comes from exothermic chemical reactions. As discussed in a previous lesson, exothermic reactions are those that include heat as one of its reactions products. Under the right circumstances, the heat released during an exothermic reaction can be sufficient to start a fire.\n\nElectrical\n\nElectrical sources of heat are, as the name implies, electrical devices. Under normal circumstances, appliances will only produce heat according to the constraints of their design. For instance, heat may be generated as a by-product of normal operation or an electrical appliance may be specifically made to provide heat, such as in the case of heaters. These are generally of no concern.\n\nHowever, these devices can sometimes malfunction due to the poor quality of materials and/or construction. When this happens, the device produces an unexpected amount of heat that could be responsible for fires.\n\nElectricity can come from the smallest sources, like a tiny watch battery, to the largest, such as a lightning bolt. An investigator would be remiss for not being familiar with the materials included in this wide variety.\n\nNuclear\n\nAs mentioned in the previous lesson, we have a special category of fuels called nuclear fuels. Initially, they were mainly utilized for their devastating potential, such as when the atom bomb was first manufactured. Today, however, nuclear fuels are being used for their energy production capabilities. Of course, the planet still has enough stores of nuclear weapons that could destroy the Earth many times over.\n\nSpontaneous heating, or heating that occurs without an external source, can also occur biologically. Decaying matter gives off heat as they break down. If the heat is contained, the temperature of the material can keep rising to its ignition temperature. If a sufficient amount of oxygen is available, it can result in spontaneous ignition.\n\n\nHeat Transfer\n\nIn sum:\n\n * conduction: transfer of heat via direct contact between two bodies or through a heat-conducting medium\n * convection: heat transfer through a circulating medium, usually air or liquids\n * radiation: movement of heat via waves\n\n\nTemperature Scales\n\n * Celsius Originally known as the \"centigrade scale\", °C, is commonly used in scientific works\n * Fahrenheit Symbolized by °F; Mostly used in English-speaking countries for purposes other than scientific works\n * Kelvin K; Most commonly used thermodynamic scale with 0 K defined as the absolute zero temperature equivalent to -273.15 °C or –459.67 °F\n\nOther notable temperature scales:\n\n * Rankine °R: Another temperature scale that has an absolute zero at its lowest point.

Class C fuels are only potentially dangerous while electricity is running through them. Class D fuels can be explosive on their own.\n\n\nGeneral Categories of Combustible Materials\n\n * Solid Includes metallic solid materials, whether they are natural or synthetic, organic or inorganic\n * Liquid Includes chemicals and all flammable liquids\n * Gaseous Includes hazardous or toxic gases that are capable of ignition\n\n\nSolid Fuels\n\nThe most common solid fuels are wood, paper, and cloth. Their burning rates depend upon their configurations. For instance, a pile of crumpled pieces of paper will burn faster than a stack of neatly folded sheets.\n\nKinds of Flammable Solids\n\n * Pyrolyzable solid fuels are those materials that are commonly known as easy to burn, including wood and paper.

They are frequently utilized in processing plants. In the country, rice hulls are a common waste product that is transformed into power.\n\nEffects of various factors on the combustibility of wood and wood-based products:\n\n * physical form - the smaller the pieces, the easier/faster they burn\n * moisture/water content - as shown in a video in a previous lesson, dry wood burns faster than fresh wood\n * heat conductivity - the higher the conductivity, the faster the material burns\n * rate and period of heating - less-flammable materials do not readily ignite\n * rate of combustion - fuel is consumed faster if the combustion is more intense\n * ignition temperature - the lower the number, the faster it will be reached, thus the fire can start sooner\n\nFabrics and Textiles\n\nFibers are very delicate and thin strands of material. Fabrics are twisted or woven fibers. While textiles are machine-woven or knitted fabrics.\n\nClassifications of Fabrics\n\n * Natural Fibers come from animals (e.g. wool, silk), plants (e.g. abaca, pineapple, coconut), and minerals (e.g. asbestos).\n * Synthetic or Artificial Fibers are manmade and synthesized from various chemicals. Examples include acetate, fiberglass, and steel.\n\nEffect of various factors on the combustibility of fibers\n\n * chemical composition - Natural and artificial fibers are generally highly combustible, especially when they're dry. Mineral and artificial inorganic fibers are usually fire-resistant.\n * fiber finish or coating merged with organic fibers supports the continued burning of the fabric\n * fabric weight - heavier fabrics resist ignition\n * tightness of weave - tighter woven cloth take more time to ignite\n * flame retardant treatment - as the name implies, treated cloth has higher ignition resistance\n\nFabric Ignition\n\nLimiting Oxygen Index (LOI) is a measure of the tendency of a fabric to continue burning after the initial ignition source is removed. Fabrics with higher LOI and ignition temperature are safer for clothing and furniture because they are likely to cease burning once the initial flame is removed.\n\nPlastics are categorized as Class A fuels except for cellulose nitrate or those that contain it. It is a chemical powder used in bombs and is also called pyroxylin.\n\nCoal is a black, combustible, solid mineral that is produced when matter undergoes partial decomposition due to exposure to varying temperatures. It is generally used to heat buildings and energize machinery.\n\nCoal comes in the following forms: lignite or brown coal, sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and anthracite.\n\nBituminous coal contains more carbon and produces more heat than either lignite or sub-bituminous coal. Thus, it is considered the most important type of coal in industry. Bituminous coal also appears most abundantly in nature.\n\nAnthracite, while it contains more carbon and produces more heat than the other types, is not used as much since it is the toughest type of coal making it difficult to ignite and slow-burning.

Additionally, just as the case for solids, sufficient heat must be available to turn liquid fuels into gas for combustion to occur.\n\nTypes of Liquid Fuels\n\n\nGaseous Fuels\n\nFinally, we have gaseous fuels, or those fuels that exist in gaseous form.\n\nMolecules of gases are in relative free motion.

Some of them, like carbon dioxide, are even used to extinguish fires.\n\nClassifications of Gaseous Fuels\n\nAccording to Source\n\n * Natural Gas is used to heat buildings, cook food, and provide energy. Methane, the chief component of natural gas, is a colorless and odorless gas. Hence, foul-smelling substances, like sulfur, are usually added to them to help detect leaks. Common examples are butane and propane. They are easily contained and distributed when pressurized into liquid form. They change back into gas when pressure is removed.\n * Manufactured Gas is used when other types are scarce. Coal, petroleum, and biomass can be converted to gas through various chemical processes.\n\nAccording to Physical Properties\n\n * Compressed Gas Exist as a gas in its container even under normal temperatures\n * Liquified Gas Partly liquid and partly gaseous in its container\n * Cryogenic Gas Liquified gas which exist in its container at a temperature far below normal atmospheric temperature, usually slightly above its boiling point, and low to moderate pressure.\n\nAccording to Usage\n\n * Fuel For use in generating heat, power, light, and comfort\n * Industrial For use in processes as welding and cutting, refrigeration, water treatment, etc.\n * Medical For use in treatments such as anesthesia and respiratory therapy\n\n\nSpecial Classifications of Fuels\n\n * Chemical Fuels Used chiefly in rocket engines, chemical fuels, which can be in solid or liquid form, produce great amounts of heat a power. They are made up of a fuel and an oxidizer, such as nitrogen tetroxide. Hydrazine is common rocket fuel. (The skeletal formula of this substance is shown here.) Chemical fuels are also used in racing cars.\n * Nuclear Fuels These provide energy through the fission or fusion of atoms. The most commonly used nuclear fuel is uranium, but plutonium may also be used. They are mainly used to generate electricity, but they can also be used to power some submarines and ships.\n\n\nOxygen\n\nAs previously discussed, oxygen is a chemical element with the chemical symbol O. As a gas, it exists as a colorless, odorless, tasteless substance in the form of O2. It occurs freely in the air and combines easily with other elements.\n\n← Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Fire Science\n\nChapter 3: Behavior of Fire →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-fire-2-2.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 08:17:42","updated_at":"2024-11-12 08:45:21","published_at":"2024-07-03 10:02:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6733117afd845a448faa16ae","uuid":"fa1fd787-c706-4eae-b7c2-3423bd491287","title":"Behavior of Fire","slug":"behavior-of-fire","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The behavior of fire is affected by many factors.

As we already know, the following three elements are present in fires: heat, fuel, and oxygen. The properties of each one affects how the fire burns. Fire spreads naturally following a path of least resistance. It means that the fire will firstly go after materials easiest to burn.\n\nTo help understand the behavior of fire, it is important to understand the following concepts:\n\n * thermal balance This refers to the rising movement or pattern of fire, the normal behavior when the pattern is undisturbed.\n * thermal imbalance This refers to the abnormal movement of fire due to the interference of foreign matter. This thermal imbalance often confuses investigators as to the exact point of origin of a fire.\n\n\nDangerous Behavior of Fire\n\nFire becomes fatal when the following occurs:\n\n * backdraft\n * flashover\n * biteback\n * flash fire\n\nBackdraft\n\nThe sudden and rapid burning of heated gases in a confined area that occurs as an explosion. This generally occurs due to improper ventilation. Highly flammable vapors may accumulate in improperly ventilated rooms that when such a room is opened, oxygen from the outside get violently sucked in which could then result in a combustion explosion.\n\nA video demonstrating backdrafts can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6CFt74ktBw.\n\nFlashover\n\nThis is the sudden ignition of accumulated radical gases produced when there is incomplete combustion of fuels.\n\nThis is initiated by a spark or flash produced when the temperature rises until flash point is reached. When the accumulated gases suddenly burn, a very intense fire can occur. This fire can create fireballs capable of flying over a hundred yards within seconds.\n\nBiteback\n\nThis occurs when fire resists attempts at extinguishment and becomes stronger instead.\n\nFlash Fire\n\nA fire that ignites and spreads very quickly at a high temperature, but only lasts a short while.\n\nIt is also sometimes called a dust explosion.\n\n\nStages of Fire\n\nIncipient Phase (Growth Stage)\n\nThis is the beginning stage of the fire. The following can be observed when a fire is in this stage:\n\n * normal room temperature\n * the temperature at the base of the fire is 400-800°F\n * ceiling temperature is about 200°F\n * The pyrolysis products are mostly water vapor and carbon dioxide, small quantities of carbon monoxide and maybe sulfides.\n\nFree-Burning Phase (Fully-Developed Stage)\n\nDuring this stage, materials are burning freely in the presence of adequate oxygen. The following characterize this stage:\n\n * accelerated pyrolysis takes place\n * convection currents form\n * temperature at base is at 800-1000°F\n * pyrolytic decomposition moves upward on the walls leaving burnt patterns (fire fingerprints)\n * occurrences of flashovers\n\nSmoldering Phase (Decay Stage)\n\nFire can be said to have reached this stage when there are no more flames. Instead, dense smoke and heat completely fill a confined room. The following can be observed in this phase:\n\n * heat develops in layers and flames vanish due to oxygen levels dropping to around 13%\n * incomplete combustion products increase in volume, especially carbon monoxide\n * ceiling temperature is at 1000-1300°F\n * heat and pressure builds up\n * backdrafts can occur\n\n← Chapter 2: Elements of Fire\n\nChapter 4: Classifications of Fire →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-fire-2-3.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 08:27:38","updated_at":"2024-11-12 08:45:42","published_at":"2024-07-03 10:03:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"673311e3fd845a448faa16bc","uuid":"f5466ae4-1c41-4330-99fd-1aa27377bb49","title":"Classifications of Fires","slug":"classifications-of-fires","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Determining the cause of a fire is the principal task of a fire investigator during the conduct of a post-fire examination of a fire scene.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"To do this, an investigator will want to locate the \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"point of origin\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" of a fire.

If the point of origin of a fire cannot be identified or if it is determined that it started over a larger area, the term area of origin is used.\n\nFrom there, a detailed inspection of the area can lead the investigator to the exact cause of the fire. This inspection is done by examining the charred debris and other residues found at the point of origin.\n\nFires can be classified in two ways: according to cause and according to burning fuel.\n\n\nBased on Cause\n\nThese can be used to classify both causes of fires and fires themselves.\n\n\nNatural\n\nThese fires involve events that are sometimes called \"Acts of God\". The most famous example of natural fires are wildfires.\n\nAs discussed in the video, wildfires can be caused by lightning, lava, or earthquakes.

The purpose of the activity is to save lives and property. It is one of the core emergency services in every community. Regardless of location, firefighters are called on to risk their own life and limb to save others.</p><p>In the olden days, communities would assemble and attempt to put out fires whenever they break out.

The purpose of the activity is to save lives and property. It is one of the core emergency services in every community. Regardless of location, firefighters are called on to risk their own life and limb to save others.\n\nIn the olden days, communities would assemble and attempt to put out fires whenever they break out. However, this often resulted in an entire neighborhood getting burnt down before the fire is snuffed out. Modern firefighting techniques and equipment have been developed since then, but modern societies also now have corps of personnel who are specifically trained in firefighting.\n\nWhile it is not the focus of our course, it is important to note that modern firefighters are trained in more than firefighting. They are also trained in search, rescue, and medical operations that they use to help people during times of accidents and natural disasters.\n\n\nHistory of Firefighting Corps\n\n\nHistory of Firefighting Equipment\n\n\nBureau of Fire Protection\n\nRepublic Act 6975, the Department of Interior and Local Government Act of 1990, created the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) (Chapter 4, Section 13-59) to be the responsible body for all concerns related to fires in the country.\n\nFire Protection refers to the various methods used by the bureau to control destructive fires to prevent the loss of life and property. Its objectives are the following:\n\n 1. To prevent destructive fires from starting\n 2. To extinguish destructive fires\n 3. To confine a destructive fire at its origin\n 4. To prevent the loss of life and property during fires\n\nFire Prevention and Suppression refers to the various safety measures employed to stop harmful or destructive fires from starting.\n\nThe BFP is the official firefighting corps of the Philippine government. Their main firefighting tools are ladders and pumps, but they also have specialist vehicles that are equipped with turntable ladders, hydraulic platforms, extra water, foam, and other specialized appliances for hazardous incidents.\n\nIn some countries, like the US, firefighting corps are divided into two sub-units: the engine company and the ladder company. Engine companies are equipped with trucks called \"engines\" that carry pumps and hoses for spraying water into fires. Ladder companies have ladder trucks for rescuing people through windows or spraying water from an elevated position.\n\n\nFactors Affecting Fire Protection and Control\n\nA fire hazard is anything that increases or could increase the probability of a fire in the area or could obstruct, delay, hinder or interfere with firefighting operations and the safeguarding of lives and property.\n\n\nCommon Fire Hazards\n\n * Storage of an excessive amount of combustibles or explosives in an area not designed for such a purpose\n * Deficient facilities/equipment\n * Lack of suitable exits\n * Obstructions at fire escapes or other entrances designated for firefighters\n * Unsafe amounts of rubbish and other highly combustible materials\n * Accumulation of dust in vents or grease in kitchens\n * Buildings in repair\n * Decrepit buildings, especially those made of combustible materials\n\n\nFirefighting Operations\n\nFirefighting operations are fire suppression activities.\n\nThey generally follow these steps:\n\n 1. PRE-FIRE PLANNING development of a systematic course of action that may be performed to realize the objectives of fire protection; the process of establishing an SOP for when a fire breaks out\n 2. EVALUATION / SIZE-UP (on-the-spot situation assessment) During this time, officers gauge the situation to determine the course of action that will lead to success.\n\nEvaluation Steps:\n\n      1. Learn the facts of the situation: 5W's 1H\n      2. Determine the probabilities of dangerous fire behavior (as discussed in Lesson 2.2)\n      3. Ascertain your capabilities\n      4. Decide on the course of action\n\n 2.  EVACUATION moving people, livestock, and property away from the fire area\n 3.  ENTRY accessing the burning structure If necessary, entry may be forced:\n      1. To give access to firefighters and their firefighting equipment\n      2. To provide rescue\n      3. To aid in ventilation\n\n 4.  RESCUE removing, thus saving, people, livestock, and property from a fire area and transferring them to a secure area\n 5.  EXPOSURE cover exposure securing structures surrounding the fire area to prevent the spread of fire\n 6.  CONFINEMENT restricting the fire to the fire area\n 7.  VENTILATION displacing the heated atmosphere with normal air to expel toxic gases\n 8.  SALVAGE protecting properties from preventable damage from factors other than fire by removing them from the fire area and covering them with material such as tarps\n 9.  EXTINGUISHMENT putting out the main body of the fire\n 10. OVERHAUL complete and detailed inspection of the structure and everything therein to eliminate the possibility of a re-flash; includes the complete extinguishment of sparks and glowing embers\n 11. FIRE SCENE INVESTIGATION an inquiry into the nature of the fire\n\n\nObjects of Firefighting Operations\n\n * Fighting building fires\n * Fighting forest fires\n * Emergency rescue operations\n * Emergency medical operations\n * Fire prevention and fire safety\n * Public building inspections\n * Public education programs\n\n\nSpecial Notes\n\nSprinkle System A network of pipes installed in buildings that carry water to nozzles in the ceiling. The heat from a fire causes the nozzles nearby to open and spray water.\n\nSmoke Detector A device that rings out when smoke is detected by its sensors\n\n\nThe Fire Extinguishment Theory\n\nAs has already been mentioned since the fire triangle was discussed, a fire cannot happen if even just one element is absent. This is core of the Fire Extinguishment Theory which states: \"to extinguish a fire, interrupt or eliminate the supply of any or all the elements of fire.\" Essentially, fire can be eliminated by decreasing the temperature, eradicating the fuel supply, suffocating the fire, or by stopping the chemical reaction.\n\n\n4 General Methods of Fire Extinguishment\n\n * Extinguishment by Temperature Reduction\n   * Cooling the environment, usually done by adding water into the system\n   * Decreasing the temperature of the fuel itself to the point where it can no longer produce vapors that burn\n * Extinguishment by Fuel Removal\n   * Stopping the flow of liquid fuel\n   * Inhibiting the production of flammable gases\n   * Removing the solid fuels at the fire path\n   * Letting the fire burn until all fuel is consumed\n * Extinguishment by Oxygen Dilution\n   * By introducing inert gases\n   * By separating oxygen from the fuel\n * Extinguishment by Chemical Inhibition This is usually done on gas or liquid fires using specialized dry chemicals or halons that interrupt the production of flames.\n\n\nMethods of Extinguishing the Different Classes of Fires\n\nClass A Fires: by quenching and cooling\n\nClass B Fires: by smothering or blanketing\n\nClass C Fires: by non-conducting extinguishing agent; the safest procedure is always to de-energize the circuit\n\nClass D Fires: by using specialized agents marked specifically for metals\n\nClass E Fires: by a combination of the aforementioned\n\n\nFire Extinguishers\n\nA fire extinguisher is a mechanical device, usually made of metal, containing chemicals, fluids or gasses for stopping fires, the means for application of its contents for the purpose of putting out fire (particularly a small fire) before it propagates, and is capable of being readily moved from place to place.\n\nIn simpler terms, it is a portable device used to put out fires of a limited size.\n\nTypes of Fire Extinguishers\n\n * Water Fire Extinguishers filled with water, used to fight Class A fires\n * Liquified Fire Extinguishers contains CO, used to fight Class A, Class B, and Class C fires\n * Dry Chemical Extinguisher contains chemical powders\n * Foam Extinguisher contains sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a foam stabilizing agent in a larger compartment, and a solution of aluminum sulfate in an inner cylinder; the reaction between the two solutions creates a stabilized form of CO2 bubbles\n * Soda-acid Fire Extinguisher filled with NaHCO3 mixed with water\n * Vaporizing Liquid Fire Extinguisher contains non-conducting liquid, generally carbon tetrachloride or chlorobromethane\n * Carbon Dioxide Fire Extinguisher effective against burning liquids and electrical fires\n\nExtinguishing Agents\n\nThese are specialized chemicals used in putting out fires. Examples include:\n\n * multi-purpose dry chemicals\n * Halon 1211 or bromochlorodifluoromethane\n * aqueous film forming foam (AFFF)\n * CO2\n\nMarkings Required on Fire Extinguishers\n\nAll fire extinguishers manufactured or sold in the Philippines must bear the following:\n\n * date of original filling\n * chemical contents\n * type\n * operating instructions and safe procedure in usage\n * name and address of the manufacturer\n * name and address of the dealer\n\n\nGeneral Operating Procedures for Fire Extinguishers\n\nThe general operating procedures for the usage of fire extinguishers may be remembered using the acronym PASS.\n\nP PULL Pull the pin at the top of the extinguisher.\n\nA AIM Aim the nozzle or outlet at the base of the fire.\n\nS SQUEEZE Squeeze the handle to discharge the extinguishing agent.\n\nS SWEEP Sweep the nozzle sideways all across the fire to disperse the extinguishing agent.\n\nAfter the fire is put out, check the material and ensure that there are no smoldering embers that could trigger a re-flash. Before leaving the area, make sure that the fire is properly and completely put out.\n\n\nFirefighting Equipment\n\nWhen a fire that has broken out grows beyond the capacity of a fire extinguisher or similar basic first response, firefighters come in with their specialized equipment.\n\nThere are three groups of basic firefighting equipment:\n\n * Communication Systems Fire alarms are generally telephoned into the fire department. Many countries use a simple three-digit fire emergency number. In the Philippines, the emergency line is 166.\n * Fire Vehicles Fire vehicles are the main tools that enable firefighters to do their job of putting out fires. There are three main groups: engines, ladder appliances, and rescue vehicles.\n * Protective Clothing Firefighters use personal protective equipment to guard them against flames, debris, and other hazards. The coats and trousers are made up of fire-resistant material. They also use specialized breathing apparatus to protect them from toxic gases.\n\n\nFire Vehicles\n\nEngines\n\nThese are also called \"water tenders.\" They have large pumps that takes water from a source and forces it through to the hoses. Engines carry various sizes of hoses and nozzles. Many carry a booster line that is wound on a reel. These are small-diameter hoses mainly used for small outdoor fires.\n\nLadder Appliances\n\nAs the name implies, these carry ladders that enable firefighters to reach higher places - even as high as 30 meters or about eight storeys. There are two types of ladder appliances: turntable ladders and hydraulic platforms. They also carry specialized firefighting equipment.\n\nRescue Vehicles\n\nThese are enclosed vehicles that carry many of the same equipment that ladder appliances carry, except they carry additional equipment for use in unusual rescues. For instance, oxyacetylene torches, for cutting through metal, and hydraulic jacks, for lifting heavy objects.\n\nNote that there are also generalized firefighting vehicles that are equipped with portable ladders of various types and sizes. Additionally, these carry forcible entry tools like axes, power saws, and sledge hammers.\n\nThere are also special fire vehicles designed for specific purposes such as airport crash tenders and hazardous materials units. These vehicles can spray foam or dry chemicals that are appropriate for responding to aircraft fires.\n\nNote that there are also generalized firefighting vehicles that are equipped with portable ladders of various types and sizes. Additionally, these carry forcible entry tools like axes, power saws, and sledge hammers.\n\nThere are also special fire vehicles designed for specific purposes such as airport crash tenders and hazardous materials units. These vehicles can spray foam or dry chemicals that are appropriate for responding to aircraft fires.\n\n\nFire Prevention and Public Safety\n\nAs already mentioned, the job of the fire department does not begin and end with putting out fires. It is also imperative that they educate the community on preventing fires to help promote safety.\n\n\nDifferent Methods of Fire Prevention\n\n 1. Laws and regulations\n 2. Fire safety inspections\n 3. Public education\n\n← Chapter 5: Fire Code of the Philippines\n\nChapter 7: Investigating Fires →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-fire-2-6.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 08:34:34","updated_at":"2024-11-12 08:46:46","published_at":"2024-07-03 10:06:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"673313a2fd845a448faa16e8","uuid":"772f1829-08fa-4dd9-8365-de583b2fcdda","title":"Investigating Fires","slug":"investigating-fires","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"As we have already learned, the \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Bureau of Fire Protection\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is the country's concerned body when it comes to all matters related to fire prevention and suppression.

They must:\n\n 1. Possess knowledge of investigational techniques\n 2. Have an insight on human behavior\n 3. Have first-hand knowledge of the chemistry of fire and its behavior\n 4. Be resourceful\n\nAre fire investigations complex and unique?\n\nThe short answer is yes. These are the main reasons:\n\n 1. Fires destroy evidence.\n 2. If it is arson, the fire would have been planned and discreet.\n 3. There are rarely any witnesses to incendiary fires.\n\nWhat are the roles of the firefighters in fire investigations?\n\nSince firefighters arrive on the scene well before fire investigators, firefighters are positioned to be valuable sources of information. They are called the \"eyes and ears\" of the investigators before, during, and after the fire came under control. The information they have can be categorized as:\n\n * attainable or developed prior to arrival at the scene\n * available to the firefighters at the scene\n * available during overhaul or thereafter\n\n\nArson Investigation\n\nFire investigations, especially where arson is concerned, is grounded on the Revised Penal Code. Specifically, the laws related to arson can be found in Book Two, Chapter Eight (Articles 320-326).\n\nWhat are the basic lines of inquiry in arson investigations?\n\n 1. Point of origin of the fire\n 2. Motive of the arsonist\n 3. Prime suspects (and the prima facie evidences)\n 4. Tell-tale signs of arson\n\n\nPoint of Origin\n\nOne of the most important things to establish in an arson investigation is the point of origin of the fire. If an obvious point of origin could not be found nor confirmed during inspection of the fire scene, the investigator must turn to witnesses for information.\n\nThe witnesses must be questioned on:\n\n * Their identity\n * What attracted their attention\n * Time of observation\n * Their position relevant to the initial fire\n * Exact location of the blaze\n * Size and intensity\n * Speed of the spread\n * Color of flame and odor of the fire\n * Any other persons found on the scene\n\nAn investigator would also do well to note the following fire-setting mechanisms:\n\n * matches\n * candles\n * electrical systems\n * mechanical means\n * chemical methods\n\n\nMotives\n\nThere are two types of fire-setters: those who have motives and those who don't. The latter could be mentally ill persons who need medical attention.\n\nFor those with motives, they could have set the fire for economic gain, to conceal a crime, as a punitive measure, or to intimidate.\n\n\nPrime Suspects\n\nThe development of prime suspects could be derived from the information gathered during inspection and from the testimony of witnesses. The following techniques may serve the investigation:\n\n 1. Search of the scene for physical evidence\n 2. Background study of the people involved with the building\n 3. Interviews or interrogations of the discoverers of the fire\n 4. Surveillance\n\n\nTell-Tale Signs of Arson\n\nThe following, if observed, may be signs that an arson has occurred:\n\n * Burned down building\n * Separate fires\n * Suspicious color of smoke\n * Odd color of flames\n * Extreme temperatures during the blaze\n * Questionable smoke marks\n * Unusual fire size\n * Unnatural direction of fire spread\n * Severe intensity\n * Dubious odors\n * Questionable items left behind in the burning building\n\n← Chapter 6: Firefighting\n\nChapter 8: Building Code and Building Requirements →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-fire-2-7.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 08:36:50","updated_at":"2024-11-12 08:39:49","published_at":"2024-07-03 10:07:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"673313e5fd845a448faa16f6","uuid":"be5b8ca9-6779-4a61-830d-cd49ce7209aa","title":"Building Code and Building Requirements","slug":"building-code-and-building-requirements","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Building Code\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"A building code is any standard rules for safety that must be followed during the construction of buildings.

They contain important details, appropriate technical terms, and any additional material necessary to make it accurate, arranged in a proper and systematic order, and conducive to the adaptation of the transaction's or judicial proceeding's particular circumstances. Practicing lawyers frequently utilize them as sample versions of standard legal documents. In a nutshell, these model instruments provide specific wording for formal legal papers, as well as other crucial elements.\n\nAffidavits, acknowledgement and jurat, complaints in criminal cases, powers of attorney, special contracts and agreements, and gratuitous contracts and dispositions are examples of legal forms. Summons, appearance notices, subpoenas, warrants of arrest, and search warrants are examples of official notices that are also regarded as legal forms.\n\n\nImportance\n\nAlthough spoken or oral communication is considered more convenient in terms of spontaneity and speed of message delivery, written communication is still equally important as it allows for the possibility of recording and retrieving messages that verbal communications almost cannot.\n\nFor instance, not all statements, details, and pieces of information that we get will be stored in our long-term memory. Most only stay short-term, especially when there is no personal or emotional attachment to the information.\n\nIn the legal field, lawyers and other involved parties request a written agreement for their contracts or legal transactions in order to have a clear guide and evidence of the terms they have agreed. Similarly, court processes use forms as documentary requirements and evidence for these proceedings, with legally obligatory material contained therein.\n\n\nScope\n\nLegal forms include both business forms and judicial forms.\n\n\nBusiness Forms\n\nThese are used in creating, transferring, modifying, or limiting rights to legal as well as personal properties. They also include forms related to business contracts and transactions.\n\nA business contract is an agreement between two or more parties in which each agrees to an exchange of money, commodities, or services. Business contracts include sales agreements and service agreements.\n\nA business transaction, on the other hand, is an occurrence that involves the exchange of goods, money, or services between two or more people. Buying insurance from an insurer and selling items to a consumer for cash are two instances of business transactions.\n\n\nJudicial Forms\n\nUsed in different kinds of pleadings, motions, affidavits, applications, petitions, and the like. Forms in criminal actions, civil actions (ordinary and special), and special proceedings are examples of these.\n\n * civil action \"one by which a party sues another for the enforcement or protection of a right, or the prevention or redress of a wrong\"\n * criminal action \"one by which the State prosecutes a person for an act or omission punishable by law\"\n * special proceeding \"a remedy by which a party seeks to establish a status, a right, or a particular fact\"\n\n(Definitions taken from the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 1, Section 3.)\n\nOrdinary Civil Action\n\nThis is a type of judicial action in which one party sues another for the purpose of enforcing or protecting a right, or preventing or redressing a wrong, where the defendant has done or failed to do something that violates the plaintiff's rights. The primary goal is to compensate.\n\n * Complaint a pleading alleging the plaintiff's cause or causes of action\n * Answer a pleading in which a defending party sets forth his defenses\n * Motion an application for relief other than by pleading\n * Counterclaim any claim which a defending party may have against an opposing party\n\nSpecial Civil Action\n\nThis is a type of judicial action in which a party sues another to enforce or protect a right or to prevent or correct a wrong. While such action is controlled by the rules that apply to ordinary civil proceedings, it is also subject to the unique rules that apply to civil actions.\n\n * Interpleader a civil procedure that permits a plaintiff or defendant to file a case in order to compel the participation of two or more additional parties in dispute\n * Mandamus requires or compels the respondent to perform a particular duty, which duty results from the official station of the respondent, or from operation of law\n   * Positive Remedy a special civil action whereby a court of jurisdiction commands an inferior tribunal, corp or person to perform a particular duty which the law requires to be done resulting from such office or trust\n   * Negative Remedy a preventive remedy whereby a person is directed to desist from unlawfully excluding another from the use/enjoyment of an office, trust or station\n * Quo Warranto a writ of inquity that determines whether or not there is legal right to a public office, position, or franchise and may be instituted against an individual or entity, as the case may be\n * Expropriation gives power to the sovereign state to authorize the taking of a property within jurisdiction for the public use and without the owner's consent\n * Partition the separation, division, and assignment of an item held in common among people to whom it may belong\n\nCriminal Action\n\nIt is a type of judicial action by which a person accused of committing a crime is charged, brought to trial, and judged.\n\nSpecial Proceedings\n\nIt is a remedy by which a party seeks to establish a status, a right, or a particular facts.\n\n * Petition for Escheat An escheat is a proceeding whereby the real and personal property of a deceased person in the Philippines, who died without leaving any will or legal heirs, become the property of the state upon his death.\n * Petition for Habeas Corpus Literally, \"you have the body\". In the Philippines, it is illegal to detain a person without going through proper legal proceedings. This is a legal recourse that a person may take to seek immediate release.\n\nOther examples of special proceedings include Petition for Guardianship, Petition for Appointment, and Petition for Letters of Administration.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-te_2-2-1.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12

That is, a theory is a heavily supported explanation of natural phenomena. These support come from careful observation and well-documented experimentation. For instance, the theory of gravitation explains why objects on earth fall to the ground while objects in space remain afloat. We know this because we have observed so and we have conducted experiments testing the hypotheses regarding gravity.\n\nEssentially, a theory is any collection of hypotheses arranged systematically such that they increase our understanding of the natural world.\n\nThe term is derived from the Greek word \"theōria\" which means \"looking at, viewing, or beholding\".\n\nThe general principles of a theory are derived from, and representative of, particular facts and are dependent upon the thing to be explained.\n\n\nElements of a Theory\n\n * Focus attention on a particular phenomenon\n * Fit the known facts about said phenomenon\n * Contribute to scientific paradigms\n * Provide a way for it to be tested\n * Establish boundaries and domains by which laws can be generalized\n * Enable portions which can be added or compared to those of other theories\n\n\nImportance of Theory\n\nIn the context of criminology and criminal justice, theories matter because they help us understand why we do what we do. After all, theories form the foundation of any science, including criminology.\n\nPeople who do not take interest in theories relevant to their field are basically moving blindly throughout their work. In the case of criminal justice, this is the equivalent of intervening in people's lives while being uncertain of your job.\n\nThe foremost task of any theory is explanation, or prediction. Theories should help people understand why things work the way they do.\n\n\nPhilosophies\n\n\nPhilosophy of Social Norms\n\nSocial norms, the informal behavioral rules in communities, have been studied extensively in the social sciences. Anthropologists have described how social norms function in different cultures. Sociologists have focused on their social functions and how they motivate people to act. Economists have explored how adherence to norms influences market behavior. More recently, legal scholars have also touted social norms as efficient alternatives to legal rules, as they may internalize negative externalities and provide signaling mechanisms at little or no cost.\n\nLike many other phenomena, social norms are the unplanned results of interactions of different individuals. It has been argued that social norms should be understood as a kind of grammar of social interactions. Like any other grammar, a set of norms specifies what is acceptable in each specific social group. This view suggests that a study of the conditions under which norms come into being is important to understand the differences between social norms and other types of injunctions.\n\n\nPhilosophy of Ethics\n\nEthics, or moral philosophy, is the discipline concerned with morality. The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles.\n\nHow should we live? Shall we aim at happiness or at knowledge? Virtue or the creation of beautiful objects? If we choose happiness, will it be our own or the happiness of all? Is it right to be dishonest for a good cause? Can we justify leaving in opulence while others are starving? Can war be justified when the innocent are in harm's way? Is it wrong to clone a human being or to destroy human embryos for the sake of medical advancement? What are our obligations, if any, to the generations of humans who will come in the future and to the nonhuman beings with whom we share the planet?\n\nEthics deals with such questions at all levels. Its subject consists of the fundamental issues of practical decision-making, and its major concerns include the nature of ultimate value and the standards by which human actions can be judged right or wrong.\n\nThe terms \"ethics\" and \"morality\" are very closely related. It is now common to refer to ethical judgments or ethical principles where it once would have been more accurate to speak of moral judgments or moral principles. These applications are an extension of the meaning of ethics. In earlier usage, the term referred not to morality itself but to the field of study that has morality as its subject matter. In this sense, ethics is equivalent to moral philosophy.\n\n\nThe Philosophy of Mind\n\nIt is a reflection on the nature of mental phenomena and especially on the relation of the mind to the body and to the rest of the physical world.\n\nThe philosophy of mind is specifically concerned with quite general questions about the nature of mental phenomena: what, for example, is the nature of thought, feeling, perception, consciousness, and sensory experience?\n\n\nThe Philosophy of Human Behavior\n\nHuman behavior is the potential and expressed capacity for physical, mental, and social activity during the phases of human life.\n\nHumans have a typical life course that consists of successive phases of growth, each of which is characterized by a distinct set of physical, physiological, and behavioral features. These phases are prenatal life, infancy, childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, including old age. Human development, or developmental psychology, is a field of study that attempts to describe and explain the changes in human cognitive, emotional and behavioral capabilities and functioning over the entire lifespan, from the fetus to old age.\n\n\nPhilosophy of Criminal Behavior\n\nWhen crime is truly the product of rational choice, the offender commits the act for reasons of personal gain or gratification. The behavior was under their complete control. How and to what degree, however, might other factors intrude on and compromise their ability to exercise free will? The response to this question has come in the form of innumerable theories, each purporting to explain criminal behavior in terms of specific factors. Broadly speaking, criminal behavior theories involve three categories: psychological, biological, and social.\n\n\nSupplementary Videos\n\n * Symbols, Values & Norms: Crash Course Sociology #10, https://youtu.be/kGrVhM_Gi8k\n * What is Ethics?, https://youtu.be/u399XmkjeXo\n * The Philosophy of Mind, https://youtu.be/md3qbWWhUK8\n * Intro to Psychology: Crash Course Psychology #1, https://youtu.be/vo4pMVb0R6M\n * The Growth of Knowledge: Crash Course Psychology #18, https://youtu.be/8nz2dtv--ok\n * The Philosophy of Crime / 102: Are Killers Born Bad or Are They Made That Way?, https://youtu.be/WHk3eSCeqRE\n\n← Course Home Page\n\nFundamentals of Criminological Theories →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-crime_causation-2-1.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 09:04:51","updated_at":"2024-11-12 09:41:48","published_at":"2024-07-05 09:05:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67331a7cfd845a448faa1785","uuid":"a4bd9b12-cc59-4f63-9f2b-24435d37f79e","title":"Fundamentals of Criminological Theories","slug":"fundamentals-of-criminological-theories","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"A \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":3,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"crime\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is an act or omission that is contrary to law. \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":3,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Causation\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is a means of connecting the action to its consequences.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":3,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Crime causation\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\", therefore, is an attempt to explain the relationship or connect the dots between the crime and its results.

It is a daunting and complex field where, for centuries, philosophers have pondered on the meaning of the concept of cause as it pertains to human behavior. Increasingly, research suggests that individuals are unaware of the causes of other people's behaviors as well as the causes of much of their own conduct. It is no longer sufficient to ask people, \"Why did you do that?\" because they may only think they know. Instead, modern research offers a bevy of approaches in an attempt to answer that question.</p><h2 id=\"traditional-explanations-for-crime\">Traditional Explanations for Crime</h2><p>Attempts to explain crime date back through the many centuries of recorded history. During the 16th and 17th centuries, for example, people who engaged in crime and other forms of deviant behavior where thought to be possessed by demons or evil spirits. Exorcism and banishment were among the recognized treatments against crime. At the same time, victims of crime might view their loss as divine retribution for some wrong that they or a family member had committed in the past.</p><p>Many early explanations for crime were based on supernatural beliefs or in the laws of nature.</p><h3 id=\"spiritual\">Spiritual</h3><p>The Salem Witch Trials happened in Massachusetts in the late 1600's. Women, accused of being witches, were condemned to death for \"crime waves\"&nbsp;<strong>caused by the devil</strong>&nbsp;with whom these \"witches\" were supposed to be working. The \"work of the devil\" is one of the general causes of crimes cited in the early years.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVd8kuufBhM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"What really happened during the Salem Witch Trials - Brian A.

The subject would be made to go through a difficult or painful test to show their innocence. By the principle of&nbsp;<em>Judicium Dei</em>, or the Judgement of God, all innocents who go through these ordeals would emerge unharmed, while the guilty would suffer a painful death.</p><p>Modern prison systems has its origins in this explanation of crime. Around 1790, a group of Quakers in Philadelphia conceived the idea of isolating criminals and giving them only the Bible to read. Having the Bible for company was expected to release the evil from these criminals.</p><p>Today, some religious individuals and groups still attribute crime to the influence of the devil and to sinful human nature,</p><p>The problem with these theories is that they cannot be proved because spiritual influences cannot be observed.

Similarly, criminals become criminals because it was in their nature to become so.</p><p>Although the old theories are not heavily considered today, modern explanations of crime are now fully based on the physical and material world, instead of involving otherworldly powers.</p><h2 id=\"the-classical-school-of-criminology\">The Classical School of Criminology</h2><p>Criminology basically came into being when this school of thought was founded. The&nbsp;<strong>classical school</strong>&nbsp;views the human being as completely rational and assumes that everyone has the ability to choose right from wrong. Thus, people only rationally choose to commit criminal acts.</p><p>The classical theory is based on three assumptions:</p><ol><li>All of us have free will to make a choice between getting what we want legally or illegally.</li><li>The fear of punishment can deter a person from committing a criminal act.</li><li>The community or society can control criminal and noncriminal behavior by making the pain of punishment and penalties more severe than the pleasure from criminal activities and their gains.</li></ol><p><strong>Cesare Beccaria</strong>,&nbsp;<em>father of the classical school of criminology</em>, stated that pleasure and pain are the only \"springs of action,\" and the purpose of punishment is to prevent a criminal from doing any further injury to the community and to prevent others from committing similar crimes.</p><p>Another influential early classical theorist was the British philosopher&nbsp;<strong>Jeremy Bentham</strong>, born in 1748. He believed that people have the ability to choose right from wrong, good and evil.</p><p>His explanation for criminal behavior included the idea that people are basically&nbsp;<strong><em>hedonistic</em></strong>. That is, people only desire to achieve a high degree of pleasure and avoid pain. People who choose to commit criminal acts think they stand to gain more than they risk losing by committing the crime.</p><p><strong>Utilitarianism</strong>&nbsp;is the doctrine that states that the purpose of all actions should be to bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.</p><h3 id=\"rational-choice-theory\">Rational Choice Theory</h3><p>This theory explains that, before taking any action, a person tries to consider what could be the possible consequences of his own actions. Just like the main Classical Theory, it also relies on the rational calculation to achieve such goals based on their personal objectives.</p><h3 id=\"deterrence-theory\">Deterrence Theory</h3><p>It is considered as an extension of the general classical approach. It focuses on the connection between punishment and behavior in both individual and group levels.

It is a daunting and complex field where, for centuries, philosophers have pondered on the meaning of the concept of cause as it pertains to human behavior. Increasingly, research suggests that individuals are unaware of the causes of other people's behaviors as well as the causes of much of their own conduct. It is no longer sufficient to ask people, \"Why did you do that?\" because they may only think they know. Instead, modern research offers a bevy of approaches in an attempt to answer that question.\n\n\nTraditional Explanations for Crime\n\nAttempts to explain crime date back through the many centuries of recorded history. During the 16th and 17th centuries, for example, people who engaged in crime and other forms of deviant behavior where thought to be possessed by demons or evil spirits. Exorcism and banishment were among the recognized treatments against crime. At the same time, victims of crime might view their loss as divine retribution for some wrong that they or a family member had committed in the past.\n\nMany early explanations for crime were based on supernatural beliefs or in the laws of nature.\n\n\nSpiritual\n\nThe Salem Witch Trials happened in Massachusetts in the late 1600's. Women, accused of being witches, were condemned to death for \"crime waves\" caused by the devil with whom these \"witches\" were supposed to be working. The \"work of the devil\" is one of the general causes of crimes cited in the early years.\n\nSimilar to natural events such as thunder and lightning that were supposedly caused by the \"wrath of the gods,\" crime phenomena was said to be the work of people possessed by demons or under the influence of the Devil.\n\nDue to this, the trial by ordeal was instituted. The subject would be made to go through a difficult or painful test to show their innocence. By the principle of Judicium Dei, or the Judgement of God, all innocents who go through these ordeals would emerge unharmed, while the guilty would suffer a painful death.\n\nModern prison systems has its origins in this explanation of crime. Around 1790, a group of Quakers in Philadelphia conceived the idea of isolating criminals and giving them only the Bible to read. Having the Bible for company was expected to release the evil from these criminals.\n\nToday, some religious individuals and groups still attribute crime to the influence of the devil and to sinful human nature,\n\nThe problem with these theories is that they cannot be proved because spiritual influences cannot be observed. As such, these theories cannot be considered scientific.\n\n\nNatural\n\nThese explanations of crime use objects and events in the material world to account for crime incidents.\n\nBasically, they propose that things are the way they are because of the \"nature of things.\"\n\nFor instance, kings and queens head their kingdoms because of their divine right. Similarly, criminals become criminals because it was in their nature to become so.\n\nAlthough the old theories are not heavily considered today, modern explanations of crime are now fully based on the physical and material world, instead of involving otherworldly powers.\n\n\nThe Classical School of Criminology\n\nCriminology basically came into being when this school of thought was founded. The classical school views the human being as completely rational and assumes that everyone has the ability to choose right from wrong. Thus, people only rationally choose to commit criminal acts.\n\nThe classical theory is based on three assumptions:\n\n 1. All of us have free will to make a choice between getting what we want legally or illegally.\n 2. The fear of punishment can deter a person from committing a criminal act.\n 3. The community or society can control criminal and noncriminal behavior by making the pain of punishment and penalties more severe than the pleasure from criminal activities and their gains.\n\nCesare Beccaria, father of the classical school of criminology, stated that pleasure and pain are the only \"springs of action,\" and the purpose of punishment is to prevent a criminal from doing any further injury to the community and to prevent others from committing similar crimes.\n\nAnother influential early classical theorist was the British philosopher Jeremy Bentham, born in 1748. He believed that people have the ability to choose right from wrong, good and evil.\n\nHis explanation for criminal behavior included the idea that people are basically hedonistic. That is, people only desire to achieve a high degree of pleasure and avoid pain. People who choose to commit criminal acts think they stand to gain more than they risk losing by committing the crime.\n\nUtilitarianism is the doctrine that states that the purpose of all actions should be to bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people.\n\n\nRational Choice Theory\n\nThis theory explains that, before taking any action, a person tries to consider what could be the possible consequences of his own actions. Just like the main Classical Theory, it also relies on the rational calculation to achieve such goals based on their personal objectives.\n\n\nDeterrence Theory\n\nIt is considered as an extension of the general classical approach. It focuses on the connection between punishment and behavior in both individual and group levels. It has two types:\n\n * specific deterrence intended for a certain individual to deter him from doing crime by giving him punishment\n * general deterrence aims to deter everyone and, at the same time, serves as an example to other would-be violators\n\n\nRoutine Activities Theory\n\nThis theory suggests that crime is a product of people's daily activities. It says that crime commission is motivated by a number of factors, including situation and location. Additionally, being surrounded by offenders may also encourage some people to commit crimes. This theory is characterized by three elements:\n\n * a motivated offender\n * a suitable target\n * the absence of a capable guardian\n\nWhen these three elements are all present, there is the possibility that a crime might be successfully committed.\n\nThe presence of these things in a community could spell an increasing crime rate, but it also helps in the understanding and controlling of crime.\n\n\nThe Neo-Classical School of Criminology\n\nThis school of criminological thought emerged largely due to the flaws in the classical school.\n\nAccording to Taylor, Walton, and Young, there are contradictions present in classicism. These include universal penal measures and in day-to-day practice. \"It was impossible, in practice, to ignore the determinants of human action and proceed as if punishment and incarceration could be easily measured on some kind of universal calculus: apart from throwing the working of the law itself into doubt (e.g. in punishing property crime by deprivation of property) classicism appeared to contradict widely-held commonsensical notions of human behavior.\"\n\nClassicism concentrated on the criminal act and ignored individual differences between criminals. Neo-classicism still held that free-will is important, but that it can be constrained by physical and environmental factors. Thus, neo-classicists introduced revisions to account for problems presented in classicism:\n\n * Allowing for mitigating circumstances by looking at the situation (physical and social environment) in which the individual has been placed.\n * Some allowance was given for an offender's past record. A court needs to take into account an offender's criminal history and life circumstances when making a decision about someone's sentence.\n * Consideration should be given for factors like incompetence, pathology, insanity, and impulsive behavior. Also, certain individuals, such as children and the mentally ill, are generally less capable of exercising their reason.\n\nNeo-classicism heavily emphasizes free will and human rationality. It simply refined these ideas slightly so that they would work in the world and in day-to-day operations of the criminal justice system. This model provided a look at possible influences that could undermine volition. Agencies of social control in all advanced industrial societies have adopted this model of human behavior.\n\n\nThe Positivist School of Criminology\n\nThe positivist school opposed the classical school's understanding of crime.

He is also said to be the founder of sociology, and believed that both external and internal forces are important for understanding human behavior.\n\nPositivism emphasizes the techniques of observation, the comparative method, and experimentation in the development of knowledge concerning human behavior and the nature of society.\n\nCesare Lombroso, known as the Father of Criminology, was also a prominent figure in the positivist school. He believed that physical stigmata, such as a long lower jaw, flattened nose, and long, apelike arms identify a criminal. These biological characteristics were seen as atavism, or a throwback to earlier states in human evolution.\n\nThe concept of atavism (from the Latin atavus, meaning ancestor) postulated a reversion to a primitive or subhuman type of man, characterized physically by a variety of inferior morphological features reminiscent of apes and lower primates, occurring in the more simian fossil men and, to some extent, preserved in modern \"savages.\"\n\nEnrico Ferri was another influential positivist who developed a scientific classification of criminals, and focused on the causes of crime, criminal sociology, social reform, and effective criminal justice.\n\nHe coined the term \"born criminal\" and developed a scientific classification of criminals.\n\n\nFerri's Classification of Criminals\n\n * born criminal or instinctive criminal those who carry from birth, through unfortunate heredity from his progenitors, a reduced resistance to criminal stimuli and also an evident and precocious propensity to crime\n * insane criminal affected by a clinically identified mental disease or by a neuropsychopathic condition which groups him with the mentally diseased\n * passional criminal those who become criminal due to congenital tendencies\n   * criminal through passion a prolonged and chronic mental state\n   * criminal through emotion explosive and unexpected mental state\n * occasional criminal this group constitutes the majority of law breakers and is the product of family and social milieu more than of abnormal physiomental conditions\n * habitual criminal or the criminal by acquired habit mostly a product of the social environment; factors can include abandonment by family, lack of education, poverty, bad company; especially concerning are the ones who start offending in childhood\n\nRaffaele Garofalo is another criminologist who rejected the doctrine of free will.

Those theories* fall under the banner of demonological theories.\n\nIn the ancient times, it was believed that people committed crimes due to possession by demonic spirits. This evil influence made people criminal and sinful. There is no consideration for free will. Essentially, people are supposedly stripped of free will and made to commit crimes by otherworldly beings.\n\nDuring this time, however, no empirical or scientific experimentation were done to test this idea. Hence, it is not considered a sufficient explanation to the crime phenomenon.\n\nNevertheless, possibly due to strong religious devotion, demonological theories are still has relevancy in some parts of the world. These parts still believe that crime is Satan's work.\n\nToday, however, we have new theories that provide contemporary and more justifiable explanations of criminal behavior.\n\n\nReasons Why Delinquents and Offenders are Punished\n\n * General Deterrence Punishing criminal offenders will strike fear in other people's hearts, making them less likely to commit delinquency or crime.\n * Specific Deterrence Punishment will strike fear in wrongdoer's hearts, making them less likely to offend again.\n * Incapacitation Wrongdoers should be locked up in jail so that they could do no more wrong.\n * Retribution This reasoning rejects the idea that anything good or useful will follow or result from punishing offenders. Still, criminals must be punished. But this is done simply because they deserve it. A punishment is morally right and just in light of the harm and damage caused by the offense. Punishing criminals have no positive purpose or positive effect on the hearts and minds of people.\n\n* Remember that, based on the elements of a theory, ideas that cannot be tested nor falsified are unqualified to be called a theory.

That is, criminality happens based on the biological nature of every individual and is affected only by factors of genetics, neurology, or physical appearance.\n\n\nEarly Biological Theories\n\nCesare Lombroso, in 1876, proposed the atavistic theory in his influential work, The Criminal Man. This theory suggests that there exists the born criminal. These people are supposedly different from regular people because they possess certain physical abnormalities that make them less than human.\n\nThese physical abnormalities are called a stigmata - physical manifestations of an atavism which is a throwback to an earlier stage of human evolutionary development. In other words, Lombroso proposed that criminality comes from people who are less evolved and this is visible through their \"subhuman\" physical characteristics.\n\nLombroso was very likely to suggest that these people are more similar to earlier stages of humanity that to the modern man. They could even be the \"missing link.\" He claimed that born criminals should be the focus of actions against criminality in society.\n\nEarnest Hooton, known as the Prophet of Human Decay, proposed the General Inferiority Theory. He believed that humanity is doomed by our genetic degradation. He argued that crime comes from inferior people. These people have mediocre builds who tend to break the law because of their characterlessness. He further suggested that criminals should be permanently exiled to self-governing territories to isolate them from society and that they should be sterilized to prevent further offspring.\n\nWilliam Sheldon proposed the Somatotype Theory which advances the idea that a person's body type affects their temperament. He classified people into three groups: the ectomorphs, the mesomorphs and the endomorphs.\n\nSomatotype Body Types\n\n * ectomorph skinny and lean with fragile bodies who are introverted, thoughtful, inhibited, and sensitive\n * mesomorph athletic and muscular with active, assertive, dynamic, and aggressive personalities\n * endomorph fat, round, and soft, with short arms and legs who are relaxed, comfortable, and introverted\n\nAccording to this theory, the people who tend to become criminals are those with mesomorphic bodies because their strong physical build gives them an intimidating appearance. They also tend to commit violent crimes and tend to want power and dominance.\n\nIn 1857, B.A. Morel proposed the Degeneration Theory. This theory stated that people who are in \"lower\" social classes or races are predisposed towards neurological and mental illnesses, thus making them more likely to become criminals. Substance abuse, including drugs and alcohol, tend to be very common amongst these people, thus worsening the initial predisposition to crime. The name of the theory comes from its ultimate idea that states that the aforementioned can be inherited among generations. Thus, humanity is said to be regressing throughout the generations.\n\n\nModern Biological Theories\n\nContemporary biological theories related to crime come from neuroscience and genetics.\n\n\nNeuroscience\n\nOf particular interest to neuroscientists studying the crime phenomenon is the frontal lobe of the brain. This stands out among other brain regions as this section is involved in abstract thought, goal formation, and behavioral inhibition.\n\nWhen these things get mixed up in the brain, especially behavioral inhibition, a person could end up doing criminal acts since they would not be able to get hold of themselves anymore.\n\nAnother important part of the brain is its chemistry. Neuroscientists also study chemicals in the brain, known as neurotransmitters, that affect human behavior. There are more than a few of them, but of particular interest to criminologists are the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin.\n\nDopamine\n\n\n\nOften portrayed as the pleasure or happy chemicals, dopamine is actually involved in motivation. Excessive levels of this chemical in the brain have been shown to be related to aggressive and criminal behaviors.\n\nNorepinephrine\n\nThis is the chemical that activates the brain and body. Heightened levels can result in aggressive behavior while reduced levels can result in antisocial behavior.\n\nSerotonin\n\nThis chemical manages impulsivity. As you can imagine, reduced levels have been shown to be linked to criminal behavior.\n\n\nGenetics\n\nIn a rather backwards movement towards Lombroso's born criminal, some studies now advocates the idea that one can become a criminal by inheriting the this trait through one's DNA. Since the DNA is the transmitter of genetic material, these ideas suggest that people can become predisposed to crime because your genes could be carrying criminalistic traits from your ancestors.\n\n← Demonological Theories\n\nSociological Theories →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-crime_causation-2-4.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 09:08:34","updated_at":"2024-11-12 09:55:29","published_at":"2024-07-05 10:04:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67331b60fd845a448faa17a9","uuid":"6927a3db-caad-4b99-b754-d0d0b7b6f24b","title":"Sociological Theories","slug":"sociological-theories","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Sociological Positivism\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"This is a movement in the study of criminology which was pioneered by \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Auguste Comte\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\".

This can come from goals and dreams that a person is unable to attain.\n\nRobert Merton proposed the Strain Theory and argued that the real problem is created not by sudden social change but by a social structure that holds out the same goals to all its members without giving them equal opportunity by creating social pressure. The failure of a person to achieve a higher status causes them to commit crimes as they see it as a shortcut towards goal attainment.\n\nSimilarly, Robert Agnew suggested the General Strain Theory. He argued that the individual's actual or anticipated failure to achieve positively valued goals and actual or anticipated presentation of negative stimuli all result in strain, thereby creating criminality.\n\n\nAmerican Dream Theory\n\nThis was proposed by Stephen F. Messner and Richard Rosenfeld. The \"American Dream\" is a commitment to material success that is being advanced by popular media and society at large. This, however, is said to have corrupted American values as the focus of each individual has become the pursuit of financial success instead of a real pursuit of happiness. According to Messner and Rosenfeld, this distortion has resulted in the degradation of the individual, thereby creating criminal behavior.\n\n\nCultural Deviance\n\nCulture is all that is transmitted socially rather than biologically, representing the norms, customs, and values against which behavior is judged by the majority.\n\nCultural deviance theories posit that society consists of various groups and subgroups, each with its own standards of right and wrong. Behavior that is considered appropriate in one group may be considered deviant in another. This set of theories attributes crime to a set of values that exist in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\n\nSubcultures\n\nA subculture is a division within the dominant culture that has its own norms, beliefs, and values. Subcultures may form among members of racial and ethnic minorities, among prisoners, among occupational groups, and among ghetto dwellers.\n\nAlbert Cohen is a proponent of the Subcultural Theory of delinquency which claims that members of the lower class cannot socialize effectively as middle-class in what is considered as appropriate middle class behavior.\n\nThe idea of reaction formation suggests that delinquency among lower class youths is a reaction against the social norms of the middle class. The lower classes thus gather together to share their common problems forming a subculture that rejects middle-class values.\n\nThese theories emerged from the Chicago School and developed to account for delinquency among lower class males, especially for one of its most important expressions - the teenage gang. The primary focus is on juvenile delinquency because theorists believe that, if this pattern of offending can be understood and controlled, it will break the transition from teenage offender into habitual criminal.\n\nThe Chicago School, sometimes called the Ecological School, was the first major body of work that specialized in urban sociology. It emerged during the 1920's and the 1930's.\n\nMajor Cultural Deviance Theories\n\n * Social Disorganization Theory Proposed by Henry Mckay and Clifford R. Shaw, this theory focuses on the development of high-crime areas in which there is a disintegration of conventional values caused by rapid industrialization, increased immigration, and urbanization. Social disorganization is basically the breakdown of effective social bonds, including family and neighborhood associations.\n * Differential Association Theory It maintains that people learn to commit crime as a result of contact with antisocial values, attitudes, and criminal behavioral patterns. This was proposed by Edwin Sutherland. It additionally states that crime is learned through social interactions.\n * Culture Conflict Theory It states that different groups learn different norms and that these norms may clash with conventional middle-class rules. It was suggested by Thornsten Sellin and focuses on the source of these criminal norms and attitudes.\n\n\nDifferential Opportunity Theory\n\nThis theory combines the strain theory and social learning theory. It was proposed by Richard A. Cloward and Lloyd B. Ohlin. It attempts to explain why people initially engaged in crime and why they continue participating in it.\n\n\nConflict Theory\n\nIt holds that society is based on conflict between competing interest groups, e.g. rich vs poor, management vs labor, whites vs minorities, men vs women, adults vs children. It was proposed by George Vold.\n\n\nClass Struggle\n\nFreidrich Engels submitted the idea that crime is a function of competition or struggles between the different social classess. The capitalist system's emphasis on competition and wealth produces an economic and social environment in which crime is inevitable.\n\n\nRational Choice Theory\n\nThis was based on the utilitarian, classical school philosophies of Beccaria which were popularized by Bentham. They argued that punishment, if certain, swift, and proportionate to the crime, was a deterrent for crime, with risks outweighing possible benefits to the offender.\n\n\nRoutine Activity Theory\n\nThis theory states that crime happens because the following elements are present:\n\n * a motivated offender\n * a suitable target\n * and a lack of a capable guardian\n\nThis was proposed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson.\n\n← Biological Theories\n\nPsychological Theories →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-crime_causation-2-5.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 09:09:52","updated_at":"2024-11-12 09:55:53","published_at":"2024-07-05 10:05:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67331bc0fd845a448faa17b4","uuid":"38973a5d-3b0d-489d-ad2e-1153a2fb18ba","title":"Psychological Theories","slug":"psychological-theories","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Psychological Theories\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"These theories basically state that \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":3,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"crime is in the mind\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\".

From the crime perspective, the social ecology of crime is the study of one particular behavioral outcome of these processes: the violation of rules of conduct defined in law.\n\nThe positivist school of thought rejects free will and believes that every individual is born differently and becomes a product of their environment. It depends on science in the determination of crime causes.\n\n← Biopsychosocial Criminology\n\nDevelopmental Perspective →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-crime_causation-2-10.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 09:17:00","updated_at":"2024-11-12 09:50:08","published_at":"2024-07-05 10:10:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67331d76fd845a448faa17f4","uuid":"ba39d1c0-83c1-4164-a838-b052b402e625","title":"Developmental Perspective","slug":"developmental-perspective","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In this context, development refers to the changes that people experience as they pass through their entire lifetime. \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Developmental Theories\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" basically examine the life events of a person as they transition throughout their different life stages.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Developmental Criminology \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"is a means of examining crime through the changes in offending and problem behaviors over time.

Before the first part of the polygraph was even invented, people were already making up ways through which lies may be detected.\n\nLie detection are simply methods through which deception may be detected. This can range from practical techniques of observation, all the way through the use of the polygraph instrument.\n\nNote, however, that the polygraph machine is not a “lie detector.” Most people call it that, but it is a misnomer since the machine does not detect deception. Instead, it records physiological changes in the subject’s body by measuring blood pressure, pulse rate, etc. Interpreting whether these changes mean that the subject is lying is still up for analysis by the examiner or the computer.\n\n\nLies\n\nIn any conversation, people can become untruthful in their statements for many reasons. One of them could be an extreme fear of the consequences of being truthful. Another common reason people lie is to protect others.\n\nSimply defined, a lie as any untruthful or deceptive statement that can create a false impression on those receiving the statement. A deception is an act of misleading, usually accompanied by lying. Both are especially concerning when they are uttered with the intent to deceive or give an erroneous or misleading impression.\n\n\nTheories About Lying\n\nThese theories attempt to explain why people lie.\n\n\nFour Factor Model\n\nThis theory states that there are four underlying mechanisms at work when people tell lies:\n\n 1. Arousal Lying can lead to anxiety and arousal as a result of either cognitive dissonance or fear of being caught.\n 2. Behavior Control Humans tend to keep one’s body language under control so as not to give anything away.\n 3. Emotion When people lie, their emotions change. This can be manifested as duping delight, where the liar secretly rejoices at their perceived success, or guilt.\n 4. Thinking When lying, people tend to try and think about their statements to ensure coherence in the falsehoods told. As a result, liars tends to speak slowly and with more pauses. Additionally, falsities tend to be generalities to so that the liar can avoid being bogged down by specifics.\n\n\nInformation Manipulation Theory\n\nWhen attempting to persuade or deceive, a person violates one of the four universal maxims of conversation:\n\n 1. Quantity The information provided will be complete and without omission.\n 2. Quality The information provided will be accurate and true.\n 3. Relation The information provided will be relevant to the conversation.\n 4. Manner The information provided will be delivered in a manner that others can understand.\n\n\nInterpersonal Deception Theory\n\nLying is said to occur in a dynamic interaction in which a liar and the listener dance around each other, changing their thoughts in response to each other’s movements. The following are examples of a liar’s behavior:\n\n 1. Manipulating Information Using broad generalizations and speaking about other people so that the liar can separate themselves from the lie in case the falsehood is discovered\n 2. Strategic Behavior Control Restraining signals, such as facial expressions and body movements, that might indicate deception\n 3. Image Management Smiling and nodding more frequently during conversations\n\n\nPlacebo Effect\n\nThis refers to the healing effect that occurs when a patient is provided with insufficient treatment. The positive effect appears to come from the patient’s belief that the treatment will be effective.\n\nAlternative medicines, ranging from acupuncture and homeopathy, have been thought to work primarily due to the placebo effect. Quack medicines or snake oil from charlatans also rely on this effect for their supposed healing properties.\n\nPhysicians are aware that this effect happens yet they only employ it when no other option is available as it raises an ethical quandary due to the fact that it entails deception.\n\n← Course Home Page\n\nThe Psychology of Lying →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-lie_detection_techniques-2-1.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 10:36:41","updated_at":"2024-11-13 03:47:29","published_at":"2024-07-06 10:01:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67333ebd02ba90e4c8ea6362","uuid":"8a4929f8-5e40-441d-a075-9e04e13621db","title":"The Psychology of Lying","slug":"the-psychology-of-lying","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The Psycho-Physiological Aspects of Lying\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"A normal person’s conscious mental effort to deceive causes involuntary physiological changes which are the body’s reaction to an impending threat to its well-being.

These inner deviations are beyond control and are triggered by the stimulating effect of well-prepared questions to which truthful responses may result in punishment.\n\nThis phenomenon can be explained thus: our bodies adapt to their environments as efficiently as possible. Any change can cause our bodies to automatically adjust in order to survive. Otherwise, we will quickly perish. Our complex system of internal checks and balances, which primarily involves the body’s autonomic nervous system, is responsible for this ability to adjust.\n\nAll relevant physiological activities are measured and recorded when a person is examined under the polygraph. A physiological chain reaction occurs when stimulus is perceived by the subject to be threatening to his person. The subject’s body adjusts automatically and his fight or flight mechanism kicks in to protect him from the consequences of being caught in a lie.\n\nSuch changes in the human physiology are detected and recorded by the polygraph machine and the trained lie detector examiner can read these recordings to detect possible deception. Once again, it is well to emphasize that the “lie detector” does not detect lies. Rather, it measures certain identifiable physical reactions, such as those affecting respiration, pulse, and galvanic skin resistance, and is useful when combined with a reliable questioning technique.\n\n\nThe Psychology and Psychological Responses of Lying\n\nLying is a type of deception that involves deceiving others verbally. It’s a natural part of how we communicate with other people. It’s a recurring aspect of human social behavior.\n\nHumans cannot really have an idea as to how many lies they’ve told. It happens in daily life, especially with people who are afraid of others finding out the truth about them. Many lie to their parents, partners, friends, supervisors and practically everyone else with whom they would interact.\n\nPeople lie for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, it is done to shield oneself against problems, while at other times it is to get away from responsibilities. People would also consider the potential for embarrassment or threat if a truth is revealed. As a result, people come up with a solution in the form of lies. Albeit, it is a clumsy approach to problem-solving.\n\nAccording to a study done on self-reported frequency of lying, people lie in about 25% of their interactions with others during their normal daily activities. These lies only differ in their severity, frequency, target, and the reasoning behind the lies.\n\nLying can take two forms: short-term lying, which requires little planning, and long-term lying, which requires a lot of planning.\n\nBecause people lie for a whole variety of reasons, the psychology of lying can be difficult to grasp. The causes of the lying behavior can also be described in a variety of ways. Over time, the reasons for lying also change. Children tend to lie for fun or to avoid punishment from parents or other authority figures. As people grow older, they discover that lying has a survival value. In other words, people lie to protect themselves from a perceive threat to their survival or well-being. People lie and hide the truth to keep themselves safe.\n\nThe following are a couple of theories that have been used to explain lying:\n\n * Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory purports that the mind is made up of the id, ego, and super-ego. Our actions are said to be the result of the interplay between these three different parts of our mind. The ego is the mental level that operates according to the reality principle. The id sometimes sometimes forces people to stay away from reality because it is causing anxiety.\n * Maslow’s hierarchy of needs states that we have an innate desire to meet our needs one by one. In order to achieve higher levels in this hierarchy and avoid stumbling blocks on the way to meeting one’s needs, people could make statements that may not be true.\n\nNeuropsychologists have noticed a marked difference in brain activity when a person tells the truth and when a person tells a lie.

Another method of doing this is by making the accused walk a certain distance, usually 9 feet or 2.7 meters, over red-hot ploughshares. If the accused was not injured, this would often establish innocence. They might also bandage the wound first and examine it later as in the aforementioned ordeal.\n\nThe specific method used would vary by location. In Iran, people were made to walk over flames or having molten iron poured on their chest. If the accused died, they are considered guilty. Otherwise, they are pronounced innocent as this means that the god Mithra intervened to save them.\n\nIn other places, this might involve having the accused swear an oath then drink a sulphur potion.\n\nIn India, this trial is known as the agnipariksha. A pyre is installed at the site of the trial, a priest invokes Agni, the fire god, and the accused is asked to sit on it. If the accused is innocent, Agni will preserve him. Otherwise, he will be burnt to ashes.\n\n\nOrdeal by Boiling Oil or Water\n\nThis type of ordeal was commonly used in villages in West Africa, including Togo. In one version of the trial, the accused is tasked to retrieve an object from a tub of boiling oil. Anyone who refuses is declared guilty. In another version, both the accused and the accuser are made to recover an object from the tub. Anyone who remains unharmed is proclaimed innocent.\n\n\nCold Water Ordeal\n\nThis was a common type of ordeal in areas where which hunts were practiced. In this ordeal, the accused, specifically, one who is accused of being a witch, is tied up and then thrown into a body of cold water. If they sink, they are judged innocent of witchcraft. If they float, then they are guilty of being a witch.\n\n\nOrdeal of the Tiger\n\nIn this ordeal, the accuser and the accused were placed in a cage, then a hungry tiger is set loose upon them. Whoever survives the tiger is declared innocent. If both are spared, further elimination follows.\n\n\nOrdeal of the Cross\n\nThis was reportedly used in the Early Middle Ages to prevent duels among the Germanic peoples. In this ordeal, both the accused and the accuser were made to stand with their arms crossed upon their chests. Whoever endures longer is deemed to be truthful.\n\n\nOrdeal by Blessed Bread\n\nThe test is conducted by a priest who puts hallowed bread into an accused’s mouth. If they are able to swallow it, then they are considered innocent.\n\n\nTest of the Eucharist\n\nThis test was made for priests and monks. They believed that a sinner who takes the host will be punished with sickness or death. In other parts, an accused will secretly be given a poisoned drink. They believed that, if the accused is innocent, the Angel Gabriel will descend from heaven and keep them from drinking the poison.\n\n\nOrdeal of the Bier\n\nIt was once believed that, should a murderer approach the body of their victim, the wounds of the victim will open up and bleed. They said that this was the victim calling out their murderer.\n\n\nOrdeal of the Needle\n\nIn this ordeal, the lower lip of the accused will is pricked with a red hot needle. If it bleeds, then they are judged guilty. Otherwise, they are considered innocent.\n\n\nTrial of the Waxen Shirt\n\nDuring this ordeal, an accused is made to walk barefoot over hot coals while wearing a wax-coated linen. If they are unharmed and the wax remains solid, they are declared innocent.\n\n\nHereditary Sieve Method\n\nIn this ordeal, a suspect is made to toss beans into a sieve. If the beans remain in the sieve, the suspect is judged guilty.\n\n\nDonkey’s Tail Ordeal\n\nIn this ordeal, a donkey is left alone in a room with the suspect. If the donkey cries, the suspect is declared guilty as the cries of the donkey are considered the cries of the guilty conscience of the suspect.\n\n← Lies and Liars\n\nOther Methods of Detecting Deception →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-lie_detection_techniques-2-4.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 11:43:16","updated_at":"2024-11-13 03:48:23","published_at":"2024-07-06 10:04:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67333fa302ba90e4c8ea638a","uuid":"32fd3c1f-4d7d-46fa-8c04-4b33ce06203d","title":"Other Methods of Detecting Deception","slug":"other-methods-of-detecting-deception","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In their attempts to detect deception, people have used various methods throughout the years – most of them do not involve ordeals.

While the focus of the course might be the polygraph, we must be aware of these other methods, especially ones that continue to be used today.</p><h2 id=\"practical-observation\">Practical Observation</h2><p>This is a method of detecting deception that does not involve the use of any sort of instrument. Instead, we simply use our own faculties to attempt to detect deception. It is said that most lies are fairly easy to detect if you know how to read the indications. Some people might get away with their lies, but there are ways to tell if people are lying. Some of them are the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Start by asking neutral questions&nbsp;</strong>You can establish a person’s baseline response to questioning by asking simple, nonthreatening questions. These questions include small talk about the weather, weekend plans, anything that could elicit a normal, comfortable response. During this time, pay attention to their body language and eye movement to see how they act when telling the truth. Make sure to ask enough questions so that you can observe a pattern.</li><li><strong>Locate access point&nbsp;</strong>When the questioning transitions from the neutral territory to the “lie zone,” there could be a noticeable shift in body language, facial expressions, eye movement, and sentence structure. When telling lies, everyone gives different subconscious cues, which is why it is important to establish a baseline.</li><li><strong>Watch and observe body language&nbsp;</strong>Deceptive people often pull their bodies inward to make themselves smaller and less noticeable when lying. Many people will squirm and sometimes conceal their hands to cover up fidgeting. Shrugging may also be noticed.</li><li><strong>Observe micro facial expressions&nbsp;</strong>When telling lies, the face can potentially convey two messages: what the liar wishes to reveal and what the liar wishes to conceal. These emotions tend to emerge in the form of a&nbsp;<em>micro-expression</em>&nbsp;– a brief involuntary facial expression that reveals true emotion. These micro-expressions are some of the best indicators of dishonesty. However, it must be noted that a single micro-expression does not provide a conclusive proof of lying. Below are some examples:<ul><li><strong>A change in speech patterns&nbsp;</strong>Irregular speech is one of the telltale signs that someone might not be telling the whole truth. This includes changes in voice and mannerisms during speech. Stammering or swearing to or before a higher power, e.g. God, could also be a signal that the speaker is being dishonest.</li><li><strong>The use of non-congruent gestures&nbsp;</strong>As defined by Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist at Boston University’s Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders in Scientific American, non-congruent gestures are body movements that do not match a person’s words. For example, a person might be saying “yes” but shaking their head “no.”</li><li><strong>Not saying enough&nbsp;</strong>Truth tellers are comfortable adding details to their narratives when asked for information. On the other hand, the deceptive avoid providing further details to their stories so as not to get caught in their lies.</li><li><strong>Saying too much&nbsp;</strong>On the other side of the spectrum, we have liars who say too much. They do this to persuade their audience, and even themselves, that what they are saying is the truth. Liars also tend to use more profanity and third-person pronouns to distance themselves from their stories.</li><li><strong>An unusual rise and fall of the vocal tone&nbsp;</strong>This refers to speaking in an irregular pitch. A liar may start talking at a higher or lower pitch that their normal tone when they are telling lies.</li><li><strong>Directions of their eyes&nbsp;</strong>While the assertion that people look either left or right when lying has already been debunked in a 2012 study published in Plos One called “The Eyes Don’t Have It,” it is still alleged that the eyes are a good indicator of honesty or lack thereof. Depending on the culture, a person who is maintaining eye contact could be telling the truth or lying.</li><li><strong>Covering their mouth or eyes&nbsp;</strong>Liars do this as a simple attempt to cover up their deceit.</li><li><strong>Excessive fidgeting&nbsp;</strong>For children, they might lick their lips, examine their nails, or even shake their hands before telling a lie or when caught in a lie. The same principle applies to adults. This includes tapping or drumming their fingers on the chair or other surfaces.</li><li><strong>Finger-pointing&nbsp;</strong>This could be literal or figurative finger-pointing. That is, the speaker is attempting to redirect the focus from their person to someone else.</li><li><strong>Self-identifying as a good liar&nbsp;</strong>Another study published in 2019 in Plos One called, “Lie prevalence, lie characteristics, and strategies of self-reported good liars,” those who identify as “good-liars” are a better indicator than lie detector tests. That is, according to the results of the study, those who called themselves “good liars” are those who tend to tell small, simple and clear lies to friends and coworkers. If someone brags about being a good liar, do not believe them.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Forensic professionals are trained to be able to separate fact from fiction. However, one must be aware that you are not required to be a detective nor do you need a lie detector machine to recognize lies.</p><p>Truth is subjective by nature and personal perspectives can create biases that can change what is real and what isn’t. Even the methods for detecting lies can be contradictory, e.g. saying too much and saying very little can both be indicators of dishonesty. Hence, no one should rely on a single technique when attempting to detect lies, especially for personal or law enforcement purposes. Each situation is different and each should be handled with appropriate caution.</p><h3 id=\"non-verbal-behaviors-to-monitor\">Non-Verbal Behaviors to Monitor</h3><p>Detecting deception using non-invasive means is based on voluntary supplied information and “leaked” information. Along with these leaks, subjects may also provide nonverbal cues, such as diverging expressions or postures, when lying.</p><p>The key assumption underlying these observations is that a person, when knowingly lying or deceiving, enters a psychological state that is different during honesty. These states are assumed to affect both verbal and nonverbal communication channels.</p><p>These are the main types of behaviors to observe:</p><ul><li><strong>Emblems&nbsp;</strong>These are hand gestures that have a predetermined meaning, yet they are not part of any formalized sign language such as the ASL or the American Sign Language. Common examples are best illustrated in the following emoji: 👍👌👎. These hand signs have a culturally agreed-upon meaning or meanings.</li><li><strong>Illustrators&nbsp;</strong>As the name implies, they illustrate the verbal message with which they are associated. For instance, you could point your finger upwards when mentioning “going up.” Unlike emblems, these usually do not hold their own meaning and are mostly done involuntarily and instinctively. When talking face-to-face, these help people understand each other better. Yet, some people still do them during phone conversations as these flow naturally from the speaker without them thinking about it.</li><li><strong>Adapters&nbsp;</strong>These are touching behaviors and movements that indicate internal states such as arousal or anxiety. They can be directed at oneself, objects, or other people. They tend to emerge as a result of uneasiness or a general sense of not being in control of our surroundings. Scratching, hair-twirling and fidgeting are common examples of self-touching behaviors. In class, during meetings, or while waiting, many people do this unconsciously in the form of pen clicking and leg shaking, among others, in order to relieve stress. Today, it is common to see people fiddling with their smartphones to help them relax.</li></ul><p>This last type of nonverbal behavior serves no real purpose during communication and often detract from it. Hence, they could also indicate deception as they could be showing anxiety from the speaker due to the questioning.</p><h2 id=\"early-scientific-methods-of-detecting-deception\">Early Scientific Methods of Detecting Deception</h2><h3 id=\"hypnotism\">Hypnotism</h3><p>Friedrich Anton Mesmer, from whose name we derive the word mesmerize, pioneered this approach in 1778. His work was based on animal magnetism, which was shown to provide a healing effect on his audience.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/10/graphic-lie_detection-2.2.01-hypnosis_clock.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/10/graphic-lie_detection-2.2.01-hypnosis_clock.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/10/graphic-lie_detection-2.2.01-hypnosis_clock.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1600/2024/10/graphic-lie_detection-2.2.01-hypnosis_clock.jpg 1600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/10/graphic-lie_detection-2.2.01-hypnosis_clock.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>The word hypnosis itself is derived from the Greek word, hypnos. It means sleep. While it is common in popular culture to depict someone undergoing hypnosis as being made to sleep, the name is actually a misnomer since the participant is really being forced into a reduced state of awareness while still being awake. This is why James Braid, a Scottish surgeon and one of the founders of modern hypnosis, attempted to retract the name when he realized that it had nothing to do with sleep, making the name rather deceptive.</p><p>Other famous personalities who studied hypnosis include Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, and Thomas Edison.</p><p>Initially, hypnosis was almost discredited because the work of Mesmer turned out to be inaccurate. However, it has been found that the phenomenon was only not explained well, but does exist. Currently, this technique is used by every branch of the military, professional athletes, and politicians. It was accepted by the American Medical Association in the 1950’s.</p><h3 id=\"word-association-test\">Word Association Test</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ALlJJT62VA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Skyfall - Word Test and Bullet Removal (1080p)\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; display: block; position: absolute; width: 720px; height: 406.8px; left: 0px; top: 0px;\"></iframe><figcaption><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">TheSupererogatoryGuy | Skyfall - Word Test and Bullet Removal (1080p)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>This is a psychological method introduced by&nbsp;<strong>Sir Francis Galton</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>1879</strong>. In this method, the subject is given a word and responds with the first thing that comes to mind. It is a highly-acclaimed subtle strategy that is said to be able to catch out liars.</p><p>Galton’s experiments were later developed by Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychologist and the founder of analytic psychology.</p><h3 id=\"truth-serum\">Truth Serum</h3><p><strong>Dr. Edward Mandel House</strong>, a US physicist, diplomat, and confidential advisor to former US president Woodrow Wilson, pioneered the process. It involves the use of a drug called&nbsp;<strong><em>hyosine hydrobromide</em></strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Scopolamine</strong>) hypodermically given in repeated doses before delirium is induced. When interrogated in this state, subjects are said to be truthful.</p><p>This drug was first “discovered” by obstetrician&nbsp;<strong>Dr. Robert House</strong>. He observed that the drug would put patients into a state he called “twilight sleep.” Under this state, patients readily delivered information. He theorized that this could then be used as a “truth-inducing drug” that could be used to interrogate criminal suspects and have them tell the truth. His experiments showed that the chemical disables subjects from lying as it keeps them from using the brain’s thinking abilities.</p><p>Under international law, however, these drugs are deemed unconstitutional and immoral. Furthermore, they are classified as a form of torture. Nevertheless, it was reported in 2008 that this was used by Indian police interrogators to arrest the gunman responsible for the Mumbai attacks, demonstrating the continued use of so-called “truth-inducing substances.”</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card kg-card-hascaption\"><iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ri-6K897bs0?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"How Does Truth Serum Work?\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; display: block; position: absolute; width: 720px; height: 406.8px; left: 0px; top: 0px;\"></iframe><figcaption><p><span style=\"white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Infographics Show | How Does Truth Serum Work?</span></p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=\"narco-analysis-or-narco-synthesis\">Narco-Analysis or Narco-Synthesis</h3><p>This method is similar to the previously mentioned method wherein it involves the use of drugs, such as sodium pentothal, scopolamine, or sodium amytal, to induce different stages of anesthesia in the subject.

While the focus of the course might be the polygraph, we must be aware of these other methods, especially ones that continue to be used today.\n\n\nPractical Observation\n\nThis is a method of detecting deception that does not involve the use of any sort of instrument. Instead, we simply use our own faculties to attempt to detect deception. It is said that most lies are fairly easy to detect if you know how to read the indications. Some people might get away with their lies, but there are ways to tell if people are lying. Some of them are the following:\n\n 1. Start by asking neutral questions You can establish a person’s baseline response to questioning by asking simple, nonthreatening questions. These questions include small talk about the weather, weekend plans, anything that could elicit a normal, comfortable response. During this time, pay attention to their body language and eye movement to see how they act when telling the truth. Make sure to ask enough questions so that you can observe a pattern.\n 2. Locate access point When the questioning transitions from the neutral territory to the “lie zone,” there could be a noticeable shift in body language, facial expressions, eye movement, and sentence structure. When telling lies, everyone gives different subconscious cues, which is why it is important to establish a baseline.\n 3. Watch and observe body language Deceptive people often pull their bodies inward to make themselves smaller and less noticeable when lying. Many people will squirm and sometimes conceal their hands to cover up fidgeting. Shrugging may also be noticed.\n 4. Observe micro facial expressions When telling lies, the face can potentially convey two messages: what the liar wishes to reveal and what the liar wishes to conceal. These emotions tend to emerge in the form of a micro-expression – a brief involuntary facial expression that reveals true emotion. These micro-expressions are some of the best indicators of dishonesty. However, it must be noted that a single micro-expression does not provide a conclusive proof of lying. Below are some examples:\n    * A change in speech patterns Irregular speech is one of the telltale signs that someone might not be telling the whole truth. This includes changes in voice and mannerisms during speech. Stammering or swearing to or before a higher power, e.g. God, could also be a signal that the speaker is being dishonest.\n    * The use of non-congruent gestures As defined by Dr. Ellen Hendriksen, a clinical psychologist at Boston University’s Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders in Scientific American, non-congruent gestures are body movements that do not match a person’s words. For example, a person might be saying “yes” but shaking their head “no.”\n    * Not saying enough Truth tellers are comfortable adding details to their narratives when asked for information. On the other hand, the deceptive avoid providing further details to their stories so as not to get caught in their lies.\n    * Saying too much On the other side of the spectrum, we have liars who say too much. They do this to persuade their audience, and even themselves, that what they are saying is the truth. Liars also tend to use more profanity and third-person pronouns to distance themselves from their stories.\n    * An unusual rise and fall of the vocal tone This refers to speaking in an irregular pitch. A liar may start talking at a higher or lower pitch that their normal tone when they are telling lies.\n    * Directions of their eyes While the assertion that people look either left or right when lying has already been debunked in a 2012 study published in Plos One called “The Eyes Don’t Have It,” it is still alleged that the eyes are a good indicator of honesty or lack thereof. Depending on the culture, a person who is maintaining eye contact could be telling the truth or lying.\n    * Covering their mouth or eyes Liars do this as a simple attempt to cover up their deceit.\n    * Excessive fidgeting For children, they might lick their lips, examine their nails, or even shake their hands before telling a lie or when caught in a lie. The same principle applies to adults. This includes tapping or drumming their fingers on the chair or other surfaces.\n    * Finger-pointing This could be literal or figurative finger-pointing. That is, the speaker is attempting to redirect the focus from their person to someone else.\n    * Self-identifying as a good liar Another study published in 2019 in Plos One called, “Lie prevalence, lie characteristics, and strategies of self-reported good liars,” those who identify as “good-liars” are a better indicator than lie detector tests. That is, according to the results of the study, those who called themselves “good liars” are those who tend to tell small, simple and clear lies to friends and coworkers. If someone brags about being a good liar, do not believe them.\n\nForensic professionals are trained to be able to separate fact from fiction. However, one must be aware that you are not required to be a detective nor do you need a lie detector machine to recognize lies.\n\nTruth is subjective by nature and personal perspectives can create biases that can change what is real and what isn’t. Even the methods for detecting lies can be contradictory, e.g. saying too much and saying very little can both be indicators of dishonesty. Hence, no one should rely on a single technique when attempting to detect lies, especially for personal or law enforcement purposes. Each situation is different and each should be handled with appropriate caution.\n\n\nNon-Verbal Behaviors to Monitor\n\nDetecting deception using non-invasive means is based on voluntary supplied information and “leaked” information. Along with these leaks, subjects may also provide nonverbal cues, such as diverging expressions or postures, when lying.\n\nThe key assumption underlying these observations is that a person, when knowingly lying or deceiving, enters a psychological state that is different during honesty. These states are assumed to affect both verbal and nonverbal communication channels.\n\nThese are the main types of behaviors to observe:\n\n * Emblems These are hand gestures that have a predetermined meaning, yet they are not part of any formalized sign language such as the ASL or the American Sign Language. Common examples are best illustrated in the following emoji: 👍👌👎. These hand signs have a culturally agreed-upon meaning or meanings.\n * Illustrators As the name implies, they illustrate the verbal message with which they are associated. For instance, you could point your finger upwards when mentioning “going up.” Unlike emblems, these usually do not hold their own meaning and are mostly done involuntarily and instinctively. When talking face-to-face, these help people understand each other better. Yet, some people still do them during phone conversations as these flow naturally from the speaker without them thinking about it.\n * Adapters These are touching behaviors and movements that indicate internal states such as arousal or anxiety. They can be directed at oneself, objects, or other people. They tend to emerge as a result of uneasiness or a general sense of not being in control of our surroundings. Scratching, hair-twirling and fidgeting are common examples of self-touching behaviors. In class, during meetings, or while waiting, many people do this unconsciously in the form of pen clicking and leg shaking, among others, in order to relieve stress. Today, it is common to see people fiddling with their smartphones to help them relax.\n\nThis last type of nonverbal behavior serves no real purpose during communication and often detract from it. Hence, they could also indicate deception as they could be showing anxiety from the speaker due to the questioning.\n\n\nEarly Scientific Methods of Detecting Deception\n\n\nHypnotism\n\nFriedrich Anton Mesmer, from whose name we derive the word mesmerize, pioneered this approach in 1778. His work was based on animal magnetism, which was shown to provide a healing effect on his audience.\n\nThe word hypnosis itself is derived from the Greek word, hypnos. It means sleep. While it is common in popular culture to depict someone undergoing hypnosis as being made to sleep, the name is actually a misnomer since the participant is really being forced into a reduced state of awareness while still being awake. This is why James Braid, a Scottish surgeon and one of the founders of modern hypnosis, attempted to retract the name when he realized that it had nothing to do with sleep, making the name rather deceptive.\n\nOther famous personalities who studied hypnosis include Sigmund Freud, Albert Einstein, and Thomas Edison.\n\nInitially, hypnosis was almost discredited because the work of Mesmer turned out to be inaccurate. However, it has been found that the phenomenon was only not explained well, but does exist. Currently, this technique is used by every branch of the military, professional athletes, and politicians. It was accepted by the American Medical Association in the 1950’s.\n\n\nWord Association Test\n\nThis is a psychological method introduced by Sir Francis Galton in 1879. In this method, the subject is given a word and responds with the first thing that comes to mind. It is a highly-acclaimed subtle strategy that is said to be able to catch out liars.\n\nGalton’s experiments were later developed by Dr. Carl Gustav Jung, a Swiss psychologist and the founder of analytic psychology.\n\n\nTruth Serum\n\nDr. Edward Mandel House, a US physicist, diplomat, and confidential advisor to former US president Woodrow Wilson, pioneered the process. It involves the use of a drug called hyosine hydrobromide (Scopolamine) hypodermically given in repeated doses before delirium is induced. When interrogated in this state, subjects are said to be truthful.\n\nThis drug was first “discovered” by obstetrician Dr. Robert House. He observed that the drug would put patients into a state he called “twilight sleep.” Under this state, patients readily delivered information. He theorized that this could then be used as a “truth-inducing drug” that could be used to interrogate criminal suspects and have them tell the truth. His experiments showed that the chemical disables subjects from lying as it keeps them from using the brain’s thinking abilities.\n\nUnder international law, however, these drugs are deemed unconstitutional and immoral. Furthermore, they are classified as a form of torture. Nevertheless, it was reported in 2008 that this was used by Indian police interrogators to arrest the gunman responsible for the Mumbai attacks, demonstrating the continued use of so-called “truth-inducing substances.”\n\n\nNarco-Analysis or Narco-Synthesis\n\nThis method is similar to the previously mentioned method wherein it involves the use of drugs, such as sodium pentothal, scopolamine, or sodium amytal, to induce different stages of anesthesia in the subject. The subject then becomes hypnotized during which the subject can become less inhibited and is more likely to disclose matters they wouldn’t otherwise.\n\nThe major disadvantage of this method is that certain people can maintain their ability to deceive even when they become hypnotized, while others can become highly suggestible during questioning. Hence, you cannot really be certain what is really going on in your subject when using this method.\n\nAdditionally, an investigator with a false agenda might question a subject in such a way as to elicit incriminatory answers.\n\nIn the age of evidence-based medicine, this method is discredited as no study backed its claims.\n\n\nPsychological Stress Evaluator\n\nThe principle used in this method is the same as that used in the polygraph machine where it is said that the body behaves differently when the person is telling the truth from when a person is attempting to be deceitful. Except, instead of using the heart rate, pulse, electric activity, etc. of the body, the psychological stress evaluator (PSE) is based on voice analysis.\n\nThe video above shows a voice analysis expert manually analyzing a recording. The PSE, on the other hand, is a machine, but it basically operates in the same way.\n\n\nIntoxication\n\nThis method is similar to using the truth serum and narco-analysis in that it utilizes a drug in order to induce the “truth” from a subject. Once again, getting a subject drunk before questioning is based on the idea that people become truthful when they are in an altered state.\n\n\nBrain Fingerprinting\n\nThis is a detection method that can only be used when investigators have sufficient information that only the perpetrator and the investigators could have known.\n\nSuspects are presented with words, phrases, or images on a computer screen while their brain is attached, through a headband, to a scanner.\n\nThe idea is that a guilty party would have a strong reaction to these triggers and this will be shown in the scans. In a sense, that makes this a Guilty Knowledge Test as the results are drawn from the personal knowledge of the subject and their guilt or innocence can be shown by the intensity of their reactions to details related to the incident.\n\nWhile the polygraph remains the mainstream lie detection method today, brain fingerprinting is said to be more accurate by some researchers because the brain activity does not rely on factors that are more easily affected by the environment, e.g. sweating and heart rate. Of course, just like the polygraph, brain fingerprinting is also widely debated in the scientific community.\n\nThe technique was invented by Dr. Lawrence Farwell who has used it in at least one court case to determine the innocence of a man convicted of murder as well as that of their accuser. Both people where shown images of the crime scene to see which of them had seen it. The test is claimed to be 99.99% accurate and Farwell convinced the court to release the convicted person. The real perpetrator subsequently pleaded guilty.\n\n← Ancient Methods of Detecting Deception\n\nIntroduction to Polygraphy →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-lie_detection_techniques-2-5.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 11:44:35","updated_at":"2024-11-13 03:48:49","published_at":"2024-07-06 10:05:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6733400802ba90e4c8ea6398","uuid":"b25aa70b-ecfb-49a0-9720-33ddadf0b110","title":"Introduction to Polygraphy","slug":"introduction-to-polygraphy","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"polygraph \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"is \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":3,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"a device that measures and records a variety of physiological indicators, such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\", during questioning.

Validity is the rating of how accurate an object measures what it is supposed to measure.\n\nIn the context of the polygraph instrument, if we are inquiring on its reliability and validity, it means that we want to confirm whether it can be used by various people at various times and still produce trustworthy results, and whether it measures the body’s physiological changes correctly.\n\nOr, in other words, we want to know whether polygraph examiners can consistently detect deception using the polygraph instrument.\n\nUnderstandably, it is difficult to conduct objective research into the polygraph instrument due to the nature of how it attempts to detect deception.\n\nUnlike ballistics research where it is easy to replicate fired bullets, it is markedly more difficult to simulate the psycho-physiological responses of a criminal suspect in a laboratory setting or in a mock crime situation. Doing it in a lab could diminish the actually body responses even if actual criminals are used in the study. When using non-criminals in a simulation, they would not have the same levels of fear and motivation as suspects would. Additionally, examination results from a polygraph examiner are generally not subject to full confirmation.\n\nVarious research today still show that the polygraph is not a valid tool for use in the criminal justice system or that its validity is immeasurable.\n\n\nScientific Validity of the Polygraph Instrument\n\n\nEffectiveness of the Polygraph\n\nAccording to research, a well-trained examiner who uses the polygraph to detect deception can do it with relatively high accuracy. However, neither the polygraph nor the examiner is perfect. The interpretation would be subjective and the instrument is not foolproof.\n\n\nAccuracy of the Polygraph Examination/Result\n\nStudies on the accuracy of the polygraph test have been conducted over the last 75 years. It is difficult to draw a precise figure for the accuracy of polygraph testing in all settings from the data because many different factors are involved and the test itself is a very complex process. Nonetheless, the overwhelming body of evidence suggests that when a properly trained examiner employs a well-established testing procedure, the accuracy of the polygraph examiner’s decisions is generally in the range of 95%-100%, depending on the factors influencing the test.\n\n\nFactors that Could Affect the Polygraph Examination\n\nAll empirical methods or scientific investigative methods are acknowledged and considered by the court during trial. As such, all experts doing any matter of lab work should be very careful to ensure that no data is contaminated.\n\nThe following are some of the factors that could influence the success or failure of a polygraph examination:\n\n 1. Adequate examination facilities Before conducting an examination, the examiner should ensure that the instrument is in good working order, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, and will perform well during questioning. The attachments must be spotlessly clean and the examiner must properly explain how the instrument works and how it is used during the examination.\n 2. Privacy must be assured The best ambiance for a polygraph examination would be a room that is away from noise or any form of disturbance. The examiner should make sure that no distractions will crop up during the conduct of the examination. This is to ensure that the subject is able to maintain their focus towards the test and to make sure that the subject could not make any disturbances an alibi or reason why there was a sudden change in their physiological reactions.\n 3. Establishment of proper rapport between examiner and subject An effective examiner is one who can gain the subject’s trust and confidence, which can only be accomplished by establishing a good rapport or relationship between the examiner and the subject. Being a polygraph examiner is akin to being a psychologist in that you can direct the conversation and allow the subject to recognize you as an individual without any personal gain from the questioning. The examiner should make certain that the subject understands why the examination is being conducted.\n 4. Reaching of the subject’s level of understanding There are various types of people who will be subjected to a polygraph examination. These different types of people will have their own level of understanding and perception on diverse topics. In order to better communicate and avoid offending the subject’s ego, the polygraph examiner should determine the type of personality and understanding that the subject possesses. The choice of words is crucial in ensuring that your point of view is not misunderstood by your audience.\n 5. Permitting the subject to tell his side of the story The subject has the opportunity to speak and tell his own perception during the preliminary phase of the polygraph examination. During this time, the examiner should allow the subject to speak and share his side of the story or version of the story in order to boost the subject’s confidence and reduce their anxiety. Examinees who are intimidated by the examiner are more jittery and reactive. Allowing them to speak has an advantage for the examiner in that the subject’s statements can be used as a basis for question formulation, especially in preparation for the main polygraph examination phase.\n 6. The subject of the examination Physical and mental capabilities, past associations, economic and educational status, employment, background, sensitivity to right or wrong, and the subject’s personal projection should all be taken into account by the polygraph examiner when formulating the questions to be asked during the examination.\n 7. Chart interpretation The ability of the polygraph examiner to interpret polygrams following the examination is another factor to consider. He must be able to distinguish between responses that contain or do not contain deception criteria. He must be completely familiar with the chart markings of guilty potentials and collusion potentials, as well as consequences that will befall the guilty subject.\n 8. The examiner Among all the variables that could influence the test results, the polygraph examiner, or the person who administers the test, must be given careful consideration. The examiner must be in good physical and mental health, as well as being a professional examiner. He must be familiar with the examiner’s techniques and approaches to the examination process. If the examiner is ineffective in his work, the results may be contaminated or no accurate results will be obtained.\n\nThe Ideal Polygraph Examination Room\n\nWhen conducting a polygraph examination, the examiner must be careful to consider the following setup so as not to affect or hinder the success of the examination:\n\n * A room that is free from vehicular and human traffic and preferably on the ground floor\n * Must be conveniently ventilated or air-conditioned\n * Must be conveniently-sized with an adjoining observer room equipped with a one-way mirror, microphone, tape recorder, and amplifier\n * Must be soundproof and acoustic\n * Must have an outlet of 110 volts to 60 cycles\n * Color must not be glaring to the eyes, blue or plain white will do\n * Must not possess any telephone, decorated picture frames, ornamentals, etc.\n * Must have a system to indicate whether a room is occupied\n * Must only have one door\n\n\nFactors Affecting the Validity of the Polygraph\n\nGenerally, the following factors affect the accuracy of the polygraph exam:\n\n * the instrument itself\n * condition of the subject\n * condition of the examination room\n * the qualification and skills of the examiner\n\nSpecifically, about 15% of errors in the polygraph exam are said to come from the following:\n\n * nervousness or extreme emotional tension experienced by a subject who is telling the truth regarding the offense in question but is nevertheless affected by apprehensions, over-anxiety, even anger\n * physiological abnormalities\n * mental abnormalities\n * unresponsiveness\n * attempts to “beat the machine”; and,\n * unobserved behaviors of the subject\n\n← General Uses\n\nLegal Aspects of Polygraph Use →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-lie_detection_techniques-2-10.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 11:51:38","updated_at":"2024-11-13 03:50:17","published_at":"2024-07-06 10:10:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"673341a502ba90e4c8ea63dc","uuid":"703db96f-8067-440b-a7da-d195ee247049","title":"Legal Aspects of Polygraph Use","slug":"legal-aspects-of-polygraph-use","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In Criminal Investigations\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"A \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"polygraph \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"examination, also known as \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"lie detection\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\", is a diagnostic test given to someone whose honesty in a statement is in question.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"It is carried out by posing a series of questions to the subject while changes in the subject’s body is being monitored using a polygraph device.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"type\":\"embed\",\"version\":1,\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdx1aT2e5yc?feature=oembed\",\"embedType\":\"\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"113\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdx1aT2e5yc?feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer;

Guilty subjects are expected to reveal their concealed knowledge by responding more strongly to the true item compared to the others.\n * Peak-of-Tension Test It is similar in format to the concealed information test, but is distinct in that the similar questions are asked in a clearly defined order, e.g. Did you steal 10,00? 100,000? 1,000,000? A guilty subject is expected to have a rise in response as the questions get closer to the truth and relaxed when it has passed. It can be used to probe a subject when an examiner does not know actual values in an incident. The pattern of responses is expected to reveal the correct answer.\n\n← Pros and Cons\n\nConduct of Polygraph Examination →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-lie_detection_techniques-2-13.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 11:59:03","updated_at":"2024-11-13 03:51:36","published_at":"2024-07-06 10:13:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"673343bb02ba90e4c8ea6402","uuid":"7f74a51e-9806-4f0e-ada2-fb10350cf7ed","title":"Conduct of Polygraph Examination","slug":"conduct-of-polygraph-examination","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Polygraph examinations are generally conducted in four phases:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Phase I: Preliminary Preparations\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Phase II: Pre-Test Interview\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":2},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Phase III: Examination Proper\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":3},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Phase IV: Post-Test Interview or Interrogation\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":4}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"list\",\"version\":1,\"listType\":\"bullet\",\"start\":1,\"tag\":\"ul\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Phase I: Preliminary Preparations\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"This phase sets the stage for the initial contact between the examiner and the subject.

While the polygraph has not yet started running nor has the components been attached to the subject, the test has already started.\n\nDuring this stage, the examiner would collect information and evaluate facts. The investigator is expected to provide the as much of the following to the examiner:\n\n * Sworn statements of the suspects, witnesses, victims, or complainants\n * Incident or spot report, background information of the persons involved\n * Rough sketches or pictures of the crime scene and other facts such as articles and exact amounts stolen, in cases involving property theft\n * Peculiar aspects of the offense\n * Exact time the offense was committed\n * Known facts about the suspect’s action or movement\n * Facts indicating any connection between the persons involved\n * Exact types of weapons used\n * Laboratory test results\n * Unpublished facts of the incident known only to the victims, suspects, and the investigator\n\n\nPreliminary Observations\n\nAs mentioned, the test already started as soon as preliminary prep started. During this time, the examiner is already making observations of the subject’s behavior and everything is being recorded by an assistant or a receptionist. While in the waiting room, the subject’s conduct and behavior are also being observed and recorded.\n\n\nPhase II: Pre-Test Interview\n\nDuring this phase, the examiner interviews the subject to prepare them for the test. Additionally, the examiner must make sure that the subject is made aware of their rights as subject of a polygraph examination.\n\nThe examiner must ensure the following:\n\n * That the subject is appraised of their constitutional rights\n * That the subject gives their written consent to be subject of the polygraph examination\n * That the subject’s personal information is taken\n * That the subject is confirmed a suitable subject of a polygraph examination\n * That the subject is psychologically prepared\n * That the subject is informed of their involvement in the case\n\nSpecifically, the subject must be clearly informed of the following:\n\n * That they have the right to remain silent\n * Anything they say may be used in favor or against them\n * That they have a right to a lawyer of their choosing\n * That they have the right to refuse the examination\n\nThe following steps have been found to be an effective pre-test interview procedure:\n\n 1. As the examiner enters the waiting room to request the subject to accompany them into the examination room, the examiner should extend a cordial, but firm greeting to the subject.\n 2. Upon entering the examination room, the subject should be requested to sit down in a chair beside the instrument. Immediately afterwards, the examiner should proceed to the taking of the consent of the subject.\n 3. The examiner should then fill out the necessary data in the interrogation log.\n 4. Afterwards, the examiner should ask the subject whether they have previously undergone a polygraph examination. No further comment should be made by the examiner, but they should listen carefully to whatever the subject may say.\n 5. If the subject was not made aware of the purpose of their appearance at the testing laboratories, the examiner should explain that they are being asked to undergo a polygraph examination as part of the investigation of the case in which they are involved.\n\nAs much time as necessary should be spent on preliminary interviews.\n\n\nPhase III: Examination Proper\n\nAfter the pre-test interview and the subject is confirmed to be qualified to take the polygraph examination, the examiner should proceed to the placement or attachment of polygraph sensors. They should be attached in the following order:\n\n 1. pneumograph\n 2. cardiosphygmograph\n 3. galvanograph\n\nThe instrument is attached to the subject thus:\n\n 1. The blood pressure cuff is wrapped around the subject’s upper arm or bicep and the pneumograph tube is adjusted around the chest and abdomen.\n 2. The cuff is then inflated to a point approximately midway between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\n 3. The synchronous motor carrying the paper upon which blood pressure, pulse, and respiration recordings are made is then set into motion. The paper moves along the rate of six to 12 inches per minute. Then, 10 to 15 seconds after the instrument has been started, the inked-filled pens of the instrument starts recording. (This step will only apply when using analog polygraph machines.)\n\nOnce the instrument is properly attached, the following should be done:\n\n 1. The subject is informed that the test is about to begin.\n 2. The subject is informed that they will be asked several questions which should be answered by “yes” or “no” only, and that these questions are brief and straight to the point. They must be discouraged from making any unnecessary movements or making any comments or statements.\n 3. After the instructions are given, the examiner must wait five to 10 seconds before asking the first question so that standard tracings may be made.\n 4. The rest of the questions will be asked at an interval of 15 to 20 seconds. The test should be completed in three to four minutes.\n 5. Three charts should be obtained, with a rest interval of five to 10 minutes between each test. This is done to meet the requirement in chart interpretation that a specific response must appear in at least two charts.\n 6. The examiner should pay attention to the subjects reactions and movements during questioning. These should all be recorded in the chart, and the subject should be reminded not to move too much if they are doing so.\n 7. If the subject refuses to take the test, it should be terminated. This type of behavior indicates a dishonest subject.\n 8. The examiner will interpret the graphs and prepare the examination report.\n\nNote that examiners may write their questions in advance or create them in the course of the test during intervals between questions.\n\n\nPhase IV: Post-Test Interview or Interrogation\n\nOnce the test is completed, the instrument is turned off and the examiner makes a determination whether the subject is deceptive.\n\nShould the subject have been deceptive, the examiner will proceed to conduct a short interrogation to try and elicit a confession. Otherwise, the examiner should simply release the subject and thank them for their cooperation.\n\nIf further questioning is conducted, it must help:\n\n 1. Clarify findings on the graphs\n 2. Understand the reasoning behind the subject’s deception other than knowledge of the crime\n 3. Obtain additional information that might help further the investigation\n\n\nSample Forms\n\n← Question Formulation for Polygraph Examination\n\nCourse Home Page →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-lie_detection_techniques-2-14.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-12 12:02:03","updated_at":"2024-11-13 03:51:57","published_at":"2024-07-06 10:14:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"673432a702ba90e4c8ea64b9","uuid":"194599cf-deed-4c59-8826-3cec0238616a","title":"10 Must-Know Legal Terms for Criminology Students","slug":"10-must-know-legal-terms-for-criminology-students","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Legal terms are foundational for any criminology student.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Understanding these essential terms bridges academic knowledge and real-world application, enabling students to better grasp how the Philippine justice system operates.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Whether you’re preparing for the Criminologist Licensure Exam, analyzing Philippine case law, or aiming for a career in criminology, these 10 legal terms will enhance your comprehension of the Philippine criminal justice system and empower you in your studies.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"type\":\"horizontalrule\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"1. \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Habeas Corpus\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h3\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Habeas corpus\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is a Latin term meaning “you shall have the body.”\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"It’s a legal procedure that safeguards against unlawful detention, requiring authorities to justify any detention in court.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In the Philippines, \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"habeas corpus\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" remains a critical tool for upholding individual rights.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Why It Matters:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":2,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Habeas corpus\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" cases in the Philippines underscore the justice system’s dedication to protecting citizens from illegal detention.

Habeas Corpus\n\nHabeas corpus is a Latin term meaning “you shall have the body.”\n\nIt’s a legal procedure that safeguards against unlawful detention, requiring authorities to justify any detention in court.\n\nIn the Philippines, habeas corpus remains a critical tool for upholding individual rights.\n\nWhy It Matters: Habeas corpus cases in the Philippines underscore the justice system’s dedication to protecting citizens from illegal detention. For criminology students, this term provides insight into due process—a crucial part of human rights in the country.\n\n\n2. Mens Rea (Guilty Mind)\n\nMens rea refers to the mental state or intent behind committing a crime.\n\nDistinguishing between intentional actions and accidents is key, as it affects criminal liability. For example, the legal repercussions differ significantly between accidentally injuring someone and a premeditated assault.\n\nWhy It Matters: Understanding mens rea helps criminology students analyze cases involving intent, like those related to assault or murder. Knowing how intent is determined can clarify court decisions and deepen comprehension of criminal accountability.\n\n\n3. Actus Reus (Guilty Act)\n\nActus reus refers to the physical act of committing a crime.\n\nIn the Philippine legal context, actions such as theft, assault, and vandalism demonstrate this “guilty act,” which is necessary to prove criminal liability alongside mens rea.\n\nWhy It Matters: Recognizing actus reus allows students to identify when a crime has genuinely been committed. In many cases, distinguishing between thought and action is vital, particularly in criminal prosecution.\n\n\n4. Probable Cause\n\nProbable cause involves having reasonable grounds for making an arrest or search.\n\nThe Philippines upholds probable cause to balance individual rights with effective policing, ensuring law enforcement operates within legal bounds.\n\nWhy It Matters: Probable cause is essential for understanding Philippine protocols around lawful arrests and searches. This term reinforces the standards of evidence required before intervention, which is foundational to upholding justice.\n\n\n5. Double Jeopardy\n\nDouble jeopardy is a principle that prevents individuals from being tried twice for the same offense, ensuring finality in acquittals and convictions.\n\nIn the Philippines, this protects individuals from multiple prosecutions on the same charge.\n\nWhy It Matters: Familiarity with double jeopardy allows you to understand limitations within the Philippine justice system and how it protects citizens from excessive legal scrutiny.\n\n\n6. Burden of Proof\n\nThe burden of proof is the responsibility to prove one’s assertion in a trial.\n\nIn criminal cases, the prosecution carries this burden, needing to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nWhy It Matters: Understanding this standard is crucial to analyzing how Philippine courts uphold justice. High proof requirements safeguard against wrongful convictions, highlighting a cornerstone of fair trials.\n\n\n7. Mitigating Circumstances\n\nMitigating circumstances are factors that may reduce the severity of a sentence, often in consideration of the defendant’s circumstances.\n\nIn Philippine courts, factors like mental health, lack of criminal history, and intent influence sentencing.\n\nWhy It Matters: Recognizing mitigating circumstances helps you see how the justice system balances severity with individual context, providing flexibility in sentencing to address complex human circumstances.\n\n\n8. Precedent\n\nA precedent is a previous court decision that guides future cases, creating consistency and predictability in legal outcomes.\n\nIn the Philippines, precedents set by the Supreme Court carry significant weight and shape interpretations of laws.\n\nWhy It Matters in the Philippines: Understanding precedents gives students insight into how Philippine case law develops. By referencing past cases, courts maintain consistency, offering guidance for future rulings.\n\n\n9. Entrapment\n\nEntrapment occurs when law enforcement entices someone into committing a crime they wouldn’t otherwise have committed.\n\nThis concept helps ensure that the justice system punishes voluntary actions rather than those prompted by manipulation.\n\nWhy It Matters: Entrapment highlights ethical boundaries in criminal investigations, emphasizing the importance of legitimate policing methods that respect individual freedom.\n\n\n10. Subpoena\n\nA subpoena is a legal order requiring an individual to appear in court or present evidence.\n\nSubpoenas ensure that key witnesses or documents are available for trials, aiding the court in achieving fair outcomes.\n\nWhy It Matters: This term introduces students to the tools Philippine courts use to gather crucial information, maintaining a thorough and participatory legal process.\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThese 10 legal terms aren’t merely academic—they’re vital for understanding the country’s judicial processes and practices.\n\nA solid grasp of these terms will enhance your case analysis skills and deepen your perspective on justice.\n\nWhether you're studying for the Criminologist Licensure Exam or planning a career in criminology, familiarizing yourself with these essential legal concepts will empower you for real-world success in Philippine criminal justice.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/Leonardo_Phoenix_a_highly_detailed_cinematic_photograph_of_the_3.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-13 05:01:27","updated_at":"2024-11-15 06:37:39","published_at":"2024-09-09 00:00:00","custom_excerpt":"Legal terminology is crucial for criminology students.

But the truth is, cyber threats are pervasive and can affect students in their regular, day-to-day online activities.\n\nFrom phishing scams to identity theft, this article highlights essential cyber threats every student should be aware of and how to protect themselves effectively.\n\n\n1. Phishing Scams: Tricks to Steal Your Information\n\nPhishing scams are among the most common cyber threats students face. Attackers often send fake emails or messages pretending to be a university, a bank, or even a friend, tricking students into clicking a malicious link or entering sensitive information.\n\nAs a student, you’re likely used to receiving emails from school, so it’s easy to miss red flags. A significant percentage of cyber attacks are a direct result of successful phishing attempts. [1] Many scams involve “account verification” emails that request usernames and passwords and many fall for it.\n\nTo stay safe: Always double-check email senders before clicking links, especially if the email looks unusual or urgent. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to secure accounts further, and if you’re unsure, verify the email with the organization directly. Staying alert and skeptical can be your best defenses against phishing attacks.\n\n\n2. Malware and Ransomware: Digital Threats Hidden in Plain Sight\n\nMalware, including ransomware, is malicious software designed to damage or take control of your device. It often hides in downloadable files, websites, or pop-ups, making it especially risky for students who frequently download study materials or browse various sites. Those looking to download free items are especially vulnerable to this type of attack.\n\nStudents on shared networks or using personal devices to download educational files are particularly vulnerable. A 2023 report showed that ransomware attacks increased in Southeast Asia, affecting students’ access to vital information and threatening personal data.

A proactive approach to device security can save you from the severe consequences of malware attacks.\n\n\n3. Social Engineering: When Hackers Exploit Your Trust\n\nSocial engineering attacks are more personal than other threats. Hackers might pretend to be someone you trust to manipulate you into giving up information. With so many people sharing personal details on social media, students are particularly susceptible to these scams.\n\nSocial media is a big part of student life, and it’s easy to share information that cybercriminals can exploit.

Double-check messages that request personal information, even if they seem to come from someone you know. Sometimes, simply staying aware of these tactics can protect you from social engineering.\n\n\n4. Public Wi-Fi Risks: Convenience Comes at a Cost\n\nPublic Wi-Fi is a great convenience, especially for students studying in libraries or cafes, but it comes with risks. Public networks are often unsecured, making it easy for hackers to intercept data.\n\nMany students connect to public Wi-Fi daily without realizing that these networks can expose them to cyber threats. Cybercriminals use public networks to launch attacks, especially in busy areas like university hubs.

In the Philippines, identity theft cases are on the rise, with many students falling victim due to exposed personal details on social media.

Staying vigilant about your personal information is crucial in preventing identity theft and protecting your future.\n\n\n6. Data Privacy and Your Online Footprint: More Than Just ‘Nothing to Hide’\n\nThe phrase “I have nothing to hide” is common, but it’s misleading. Online privacy is about control over your personal information, not about hiding illegal activities. Data is valuable, and tech companies often collect it without users fully realizing its potential uses.\n\nIn the Philippines, increasing digital transactions and online interactions make data privacy more critical than ever.

This mediator is freely selected by the parties involved, but they may request the Office of ADR to provide them with a list of certified mediators.</p><p>The OADR can also help facilitate the communication between the parties and potential mediators, especially regarding their selection. The selected mediator is not required to act as such and they may withdraw or be compelled to withdraw from acting as such based on the following, according to the IRR of the ADR Act of 2004:</p><ul><li>if any of the parties requests the mediator to withdraw;</li><li>the mediator does not have the qualifications, training and experience to enable him/her to meet the reasonable expectations of the parties;</li><li>where the mediator’s impartiality is in question;</li><li>if continuation of the process would violate any ethical standards;</li><li>if the safety of any of the parties would be jeopardized;</li><li>if the mediator is unable to provide effective services;</li><li>in case of conflict of interest; and</li><li>in any of the following instances, if the mediator is satisfied that:<ul><li>one or more of the parties is/are not acting in good faith;</li><li>the parties’ agreement would be illegal or involve the commission of a crime;</li><li>continuing the dispute resolution would give rise to an appearance of impropriety;</li><li>continuing with the process would cause significant harm to a nonparticipating person or to the public; or</li><li>continuing discussions would not be in the best interest of the parties, their minor children or the dispute resolution process.</li></ul></li></ul><p>As already mentioned, the mediator can withdraw or be compelled to withdraw if they are not qualified. However, mediators do not have a specialized background or profession. If they are&nbsp;<strong>competent</strong>, they can act as mediator unless the matter in question specifically requires special training or expertise.</p><p>The mediators oversee the process to ensure that it keeps going and support both parties so that they may find an understanding. As such, a mediator is required to act impartially and ethically. That said, they are not allowed to impose a solution to the dispute.

Generally, this process is conducted so that a disagreement may not reach court.\n\nThere are four general methods of dispute resolution: negotiation, mediation, conciliation, and arbitration.\n\nThe primary law governing dispute resolution in the country is Republic Act No. 9285 or “An Act to Institutionalize the Use of an Alternative Dispute Resolution System in the Philippines and to Establish the Office for Alternative Dispute Resolution, and for Other Purposes.” This act is also known as the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 2004.\n\n\nNegotiation\n\nNegotiation is the fundamental approach to solving conflicts. It is the process of directly communicating with the opposing party with the goal of finding a course of action that works for both.\n\nThere is no direct, formal, nor specified guidelines when conducting negotiations. Most people do it every day, sometimes without even thinking about it. In some circumstances, people in dispute might hire counsel to negotiate on their behalf.\n\nThe following are the defining characteristics of negotiations:\n\n * voluntary\n * private and confidential\n * quick and inexpensive\n * informal and unstructured\n * negotiated agreements can be enforceable\n * can result in a win-win solution\n\n\nMediation\n\nMediation, as defined in the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Act of 2004, is a voluntary process wherein a mediator assists the disputing parties in reaching a voluntary agreement regarding an issue by facilitating communications and negotiations.\n\nA mediator is simply the person who conducts the mediation. They are selected by the involved parties.\n\n\nRelevant Terms\n\n * ad hoc mediation any mediation other than institutional or court-annexed\n * court-annexed mediation any mediation process conducted under the auspices of the court and in accordance with Supreme Court approved guidelines, after such court has acquired jurisdiction of the dispute\n * court-referred mediation mediation ordered by a court to be conducted in accordance with the agreement of the parties when an action is prematurely commenced in violation of such agreement\n * certified mediator a mediator certified by the Office for ADR as having successfully completed its regular professional training program\n * institutional mediation any mediation administered by, and conducted under the rules of, a mediation institution\n * mediation party a person who participates in a mediation and whose consent is necessary to resolve the dispute\n * non-party participant a person, other than a party or mediator, who participates in a mediation proceeding as a witness, resource person or expert\n\n\nThe Mediator\n\nDuring the mediation process, the disputing parties are actively involved in the proceedings and they decide the terms of the resolution or compromise.\n\nHowever, a mediator is present during the dealings to act as a non-coercive neutral party that helps the disputants reach better terms to an agreement. This mediator is freely selected by the parties involved, but they may request the Office of ADR to provide them with a list of certified mediators.\n\nThe OADR can also help facilitate the communication between the parties and potential mediators, especially regarding their selection. The selected mediator is not required to act as such and they may withdraw or be compelled to withdraw from acting as such based on the following, according to the IRR of the ADR Act of 2004:\n\n * if any of the parties requests the mediator to withdraw;\n * the mediator does not have the qualifications, training and experience to enable him/her to meet the reasonable expectations of the parties;\n * where the mediator’s impartiality is in question;\n * if continuation of the process would violate any ethical standards;\n * if the safety of any of the parties would be jeopardized;\n * if the mediator is unable to provide effective services;\n * in case of conflict of interest; and\n * in any of the following instances, if the mediator is satisfied that:\n   * one or more of the parties is/are not acting in good faith;\n   * the parties’ agreement would be illegal or involve the commission of a crime;\n   * continuing the dispute resolution would give rise to an appearance of impropriety;\n   * continuing with the process would cause significant harm to a nonparticipating person or to the public; or\n   * continuing discussions would not be in the best interest of the parties, their minor children or the dispute resolution process.\n\nAs already mentioned, the mediator can withdraw or be compelled to withdraw if they are not qualified. However, mediators do not have a specialized background or profession. If they are competent, they can act as mediator unless the matter in question specifically requires special training or expertise.\n\nThe mediators oversee the process to ensure that it keeps going and support both parties so that they may find an understanding. As such, a mediator is required to act impartially and ethically. That said, they are not allowed to impose a solution to the dispute. Instead, the final resolution will still come from the disputing parties.\n\n\nConduct of Mediation\n\nAccording to Rule 5 of the IRR of the ADR Act of 2004, a mediation process must be conducted thus:\n\n 1. The mediator shall not make untruthful or exaggerated claims about the dispute resolution process, its costs and benefits, its outcome or the mediator’s qualifications and abilities during the entire mediation process.\n 2. The mediator shall help the parties reach a satisfactory resolution of their dispute but has no authority to impose a settlement on the parties.\n 3. The parties shall personally appear for mediation and may be assisted by a lawyer. A party may be represented by an agent who must have full authority to negotiate and settle the dispute.\n 4. The mediation process shall, in general, consist of the following stages:\n    * opening statement of the mediator;\n    * individual narration by the parties;\n    * exchange by the parties;\n    * summary of issues;\n    * generation and evaluation of options; and\n    * closure.\n 5. The mediation proceeding shall be held in private. Persons, other than the parties, their representatives and the mediator, may attend only with the consent of all the parties.\n 6. The mediation shall be closed:\n    * by the execution of a settlement agreement by the parties;\n    * by the withdrawal of any party from mediation; and\n    * by the written declaration of the mediator that any further effort at mediation would not be helpful.\n\n\nBenefits of Mediation\n\nMediation allows the disputing parties to reach a resolution quickly, thus lessening the strains that the dispute might have put on their relationship. Furthermore, mediation is much cheaper than going to court to settle an issue.\n\nAdditionally, the process is entirely confidential. Per Sec. 9 of the ADR Act of 2004:\n\n * Information obtained through mediation shall be privileged and confidential.\n * A party, a mediator, or a nonparty participant may refuse to disclose and may prevent any other person from disclosing a mediation communication.\n * Confidential information shall not be subject to discovery and shall be inadmissible in any adversarial proceeding.\n * In such an adversarial proceeding, the following persons involved or previously involved in a mediation may not be compelled to disclose confidential information obtained during the mediation:\n   * (i) the parties to the dispute;\n   * (ii) the mediator or mediators;\n   * (iii) the counsel for the parties;\n   * (iv) the non-party participants;\n   * (v) any person hired or engaged in connection with the mediation as secretary, stenographer, clerk or assistant; and\n   * (vi) any other person who obtains or possesses confidential information by reason of his/her profession.\n * The protections shall continue to apply even if a mediator is found to have failed to act impartially.\n * A mediator may not be called to testify to provide confidential information gathered in mediation. A mediator who is wrongfully subpoenaed shall be reimbursed the full cost of his/her attorney’s fees and related expenses.\n\nMediations are conducted in an informal setting. This helps the disputing parties focus on solving the problem at hand and avoid confrontations.\n\nSince the terms of agreement were decided by the disputing parties, the solutions tends to be more workable and permanent.\n\n\nConciliation\n\nConciliation is the process of settling disputes in a friendly manner. The goal of this process is to bring opposing parties to a compromise to avoid taking the case to court.\n\nIn this process, the conciliator is tasked with establishing a positive relationship between the opposing parties as well as creating solutions to the dispute. The parties do not seek out solutions themselves. Instead, this is done by the conciliator after meeting with the disputants.\n\nGenerally, conciliations are fast, amicable, and cost-efficient.\n\n\nArbitration\n\nArbitration, as defined in the ADR Act of 2004, is a voluntary dispute resolution process in which one or more arbitrators, appointed in accordance with the agreement of the parties or the rules stated in the IRR of the ADR Act of 2004, resolve a dispute by rendering an award.\n\n\nRelevant Terms\n\n * ad hoc arbitration arbitration administered by an arbitrator and/or the parties themselves; an arbitration conducted by an institution is can also be considered ad hoc arbitration if the institution is not a permanent or regular arbitration institution in the Philippines\n * appointing authority in the absence of an agreement, the national president of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) or his/her duly authorized representative\n * arbitration agreement an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not; it may be in the form of an arbitration clause in a contract or in the form of a separate agreement\n * arbitral tribunal a sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators\n * award any partial or final decision by an arbitrator in resolving an issue\n * claimant an entity with a claim against another and who commence/s arbitration against the latter\n * institutional arbitration arbitration administered by an entity which is registered as a domestic corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and engaged in, among others, arbitration of disputes in the Philippines on a regular and permanent basis\n * request for appointment the letter-request to the appointing authority of either or both parties for the appointment of arbitrator/s or of the two arbitrators first appointed by the parties for the appointment of the third member of an arbitral tribunal\n * representative a person duly authorized in writing by a party to a dispute, who could be a counsel, a person in his/her employ or any other person of his/her choice, duly authorized to represent said party in the arbitration proceedings\n * respondent the entity against whom the claimant commence/s arbitration\n * written communication the pleading, motion, manifestation, notice, order, award and any other document or paper submitted or filed with the arbitral tribunal or delivered to a party\n\n\nConditions for Arbitration\n\n * Agreement to arbitration must be in writing.\n * The matter in question must involve a legal dispute.\n * Once an arbitrator has made their decision, the legal outcome is final and cannot be appealed.\n\n\nBenefits of Arbitration\n\n * voluntary\n * private, unless a limited court appeal is made\n * less formal and less structured than court proceedings\n * quicker and less expensive than going to court\n * each party has an opportunity to present evidence and deliver arguments\n * disputing parties have the right to choose their arbitrators\n * Since the decision of the arbitrator is final, the issue can be closed permanently.\n * The arbitrator’s award can be enforced in court.\n\n\nThe Arbitrator\n\nAny person appointed to be an arbitrator must:\n\n * be of legal age\n * be in full enjoyment of their civil rights\n * know how to read and write\n * not be related by blood or marriage within the sixth degree to either of the disputing parties\n * not have a financial, fiduciary, or other interest in the controversy\n * not have any personal biases\n\nThe first three requirements establishes basic competency on the part of the arbitrator while the latter three requirements attempts to ensure that the arbitrator has no conflicting interest on the matter being settled.\n\nParties involved in the dispute are not allowed to select an arbitrator as a champion to their cause.\n\nThe parties can agree on the procedure for the appointment of the arbitrator/s. If they cannot come to an agreement, the rules stated in Paragraph (c), Article 5.10, Rule 3 of the IRR of the ADR Act of 2004 will be followed.\n\nThe rule states thus:\n\n 1. In an arbitration with three (3) arbitrators, each party shall appoint one (1) arbitrator, and the two (2) arbitrators thus appointed shall appoint the third arbitrator. If a party fails to appoint the arbitrator within (30) days of receipt of a request to do so from the other party, or if the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of their appointment, the appointment shall be made, upon request of a party, by the appointing authority.\n 2. In an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to agree on the arbitrator, one shall be appointed, upon request of a party, by the appointing authority.\n\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal\n\nThe disputing parties are allowed to decide the number of arbitrators they wish to handle their dispute. Should they be unable to decide, three (3) arbitrators will be assigned.\n\nA person’s or entity’s nationality should not be a reason why they cannot be selected as arbitrator, unless agreed upon by both parties.\n\nDisputing parties can decide the procedure of selecting their arbitrators, subject to the conditions of the IRR.\n\nIf they cannot agree:\n\n * for an arbitration with three arbitrators, each party should appoint one and the third will be appointed by the two previously selected arbitrators\n * if one party cannot choose within thirty (30) days after receiving the request to do so or the two arbitrators cannot agree on the third arbitrator within thirty (30) days of appointment, the appointing authority will make the necessary appointments upon request of any party\n * for an arbitration with a sole arbitrator, if the parties are unable to select an arbitrator, the appointing authority will make the selection upon request of any party\n\nOnce an appointment procedure has been selected, any party can request the appointing authority to make the appointments if:\n\n * a party fails to follow procedure, or\n * the parties, or two arbitrators, cannot reach the agreement expected of them, or\n * a third party, including an institution, fails to perform any function entrusted to it per terms of the agreed procedure\n\nThe appointment of arbitrators is not subject for motions for reconsideration nor appeals. That is, once the arbitrators are appointed, their appointment cannot be contested.\n\n\nGrounds for Challenge\n\nWhen a person is informed of their appointment as arbitrator, they must reveal any and all circumstances that could result in a justifiable doubt to their impartiality or independence. Should the conflicts of interest arise later in the proceedings, they should divulge them immediately.\n\nTheir appointment can then be challenged if these circumstances arise. Additionally, the appointment can also be challenged if it is revealed that they do not possess the qualifications required by the parties according to the appointment agreement.\n\n\nChallenge Procedure\n\nThe parties can agree on the procedure for challenging an arbitrator. If they cannot agree on the procedure, a party can send a written statement citing the reasons for the challenge to the arbitral tribunal within fifteen (15) days of becoming aware of such questionable circumstances.\n\nWhen presented with a challenge, the challenged arbitrator can decide to withdraw from their office. Otherwise, the arbitral tribunal will decide on the challenge.\n\nIf a challenge is not successful, the challenging party can then request the appointing authority to decide on the challenge. The request must be made within thirty (30) days of receiving the notice of rejection. This decision by the appointing authority is immediately executory and not subject to motions for reconsideration nor appeals.\n\nWhile the aforementioned request is pending, the tribunal, including the challenged member, can continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an award.\n\nAny party may bring a petition under the challenge procedure to a court in accordance with the Rules of Court or the Special ADR Rules.\n\n\nFailure or Impossibility to Act\n\nIf an arbitrator is unable to perform their duties, their appointment terminates if they withdraw from the office or if the parties agree to terminate. Otherwise, if there is an argument regarding this termination, a party may request the appointing authority to decide regarding the termination. This decision is immediately executory and not subject to motions for reconsideration nor appeals.\n\n\nSubstitute Arbitrator\n\nIf an arbitrator is terminated through any of the above procedures or their personal decision to withdraw, a substitute will be appointed based on the rules applied to the arbitrator being replaced.\n\n\nConduct of Arbitration\n\nAll parties to an arbitration are treated equally. They are also given equal opportunity to present their case.\n\nThe procedure of the arbitration process will be based on the agreement of both parties. If they cannot agree, the arbitral tribunal will proceed with the arbitration according to what they deem appropriate.\n\nSimilar to a judge at court, the tribunal has the power to determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality, and weight of all evidence presented.\n\n\nVenue\n\nThe arbitration parties can decide on the setting of their arbitration proceedings. If they cannot agree, it will be conducted in Metro Manila, unless the arbitral tribunal decides otherwise considering the circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal may also meet anywhere with the relevant participants for consultation purposes, unless the parties have already agreed not to allow such.\n\n\nCommencement\n\nArbitral proceedings start on the date when the request for the proceedings was made unless the parties agreed otherwise.\n\n\nLanguage\n\nRegarding the language, the parties can agree on which ones they prefer. If they cannot agree, the proceedings will be conducted in English. This will apply to any written statement, hearing, award, decision, or any other communications during the proceedings.\n\nIf necessary, a translation may be ordered by the tribunal into the language selected.\n\n\nPresentation by the Parties\n\nThe claimant can present their side of the case during the period agreed by the parties or determined by the arbitral tribunal. They must present the following:\n\n * the facts supporting their claim\n * issues\n * relief or remedy sought\n\nThe respondent, during the same time, will present their defense to each of the above, unless the parties have a separate agreement regarding the required elements of the defense.\n\nDuring their statements, the parties may submit all relevant documents or add reference to these documents or any other evidence they will submit.\n\nUnless otherwise agreed, the parties may add to their statements during the course of the proceedings, unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal will decide whether to hold oral hearings for the presentation of evidence or for oral argument, unless the disputing parties have a contrary agreement. The tribunal may also decide whether the proceedings will be conducted on the basis of documents and other materials.\n\nIf the parties have agreed that no hearings will be held, the arbitral tribunal may still conduct them if requested by a party.\n\nThe disputing parties will be given sufficient advance notice of any hearing and of any meeting of the tribunal for the purposes of inspection of goods, other property, or documents.\n\nAll statements presented to the tribunal by one party will be communicated to the opposing party. Any expert reports or evidentiary document crucial to the decision-making of the tribunal will be communicated to the disputing parties as well.\n\n\nDefault\n\nA party is considered to have defaulted if, without sufficient cause:\n\n * the claimant fails to communicate their statement of claim, the tribunal shall terminate the proceedings\n * the respondent fails to communicate their statement of defense, the tribunal will continue with the proceedings, but without treating the lack of defense as an outright admission of the claimants allegations\n * any party fails to appear at a hearing or produce documentary evidence, the tribunal will continue with the proceedings and make an award on the basis of the evidence available\n\n\nAssistance from Experts\n\nUnless the parties have already prohibited it in agreement, if an expert is required, the arbitral tribunal may:\n\n * appoint one or more experts to assist them on specific issues; or\n * require a party to give the expert all relevant information or grant access to any relevant evidence for their inspection of said items\n\nThe arbitral tribunal or any party may also request for the appearance of said expert at hearings to testify on the point in issue unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\n\nCourt Assistance\n\nAdditionally, they may also seek the assistance of the court in taking evidence. The court may process said evidence according to their rules.\n\nRegarding witnesses, the arbitral tribunal has the following powers:\n\n * require any person to attend a hearing as a witness\n * subpoena witnesses and documents\n * require the retirement of any witness during the testimony of any other witness\n\n\nDecision-Making in Arbitration\n\nWhen the arbitration is conducted by a panel of more than one arbitrator, the decision will be made based on a majority unless otherwise agreed by the parties.\n\n\nSettlement\n\nIf, during the process of arbitration, the parties manage to settle the dispute, the tribunal will terminate the proceedings. If requested by the parties and not objected to by the tribunal, the settlement will be recorded in the form of an arbitral award on agreed terms.\n\nSuch an award has the same status and effects as any other award on the merits of the case.\n\n\nForm and Contents of Award\n\nThe award must be done in writing and signed by the arbitral tribunal. If there is more than one arbitrator, the signature of the majority will suffice as long as the reason for the omission is stated.\n\nIt must contain the following:\n\n * the reason on which the award was granted; unless it was previously agreed by the parties that the reasoning will not be given\n * date and place of arbitration (The award is assumed to have been made at that place.)\n\nA signed copy must be delivered to each party.\n\n\nTermination of Proceedings\n\nThe arbitration can be terminated based if:\n\n * a final award has already been granted; or,\n * the arbitral tribunal orders the termination of the proceedings.\n\nThe tribunal may order termination when:\n\n * a claimant withdraws their claim; unless the respondent objects and the tribunal recognized a legitimate on their part in obtaining a final settlement;\n * the parties agree on the termination; or,\n * the tribunal finds that continuation of the proceedings has become unnecessary or impossible.\n\nWhen the arbitration is terminated, the mandate of the tribunal ends as well.\n\nNevertheless, the tribunal may hold the final award to make way for a hearing to determine the costs and identify which party will shoulder these costs or set an equitable division.\n\n\nPost-Award Proceedings\n\nWithin thirty (30) days from receipt of the award, unless otherwise agreed by both parties, a party may request the tribunal to correct the award for errors in computation, clerical or typographical errors, or any similar errors.\n\nThey may also request the tribunal to provide an interpretation of a specific point in the award.\n\nIn both instances, the opposing party must be notified of these requests.\n\nIf the tribunal decides that the request has merit, they must make the correction or give the interpretation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the request. If an interpretation was requested and provided, the interpretation will become part of the award.\n\nThe tribunal may also correct any errors they find themselves within thirty (30) days from the date of award.\n\nIf a party finds a claim to have been omitted in the final award, they can make a request to the tribunal to grant an additional award concerning this omission; unless previously agreed otherwise.

The time begins on the date of the case being referred for CAM.\n\n\nSettlement\n\nIf a settlement is reached during CAM:\n\n * The parties, with the assistance of their counsel, must draft the compromise agreement. The mediator will make resolution samples/templates available to the parties to further guide them in the writing of this agreement.\n * Under the timeframe specified in section 12, Part B of AM 19–10– 20 SC, the PMCU shall send to the referring judge a Mediator’s Report on the outcome of the mediation proceeding, as well as a copy of the settlement arrangement and any attachments, if any.\n * The judge must review the Settlement Agreement attached to the Mediator’s Report, if any, and after their evaluation, they may continue to:\n   * approve the agreement and render judgment based on it;\n   * disapprove the agreement for being contrary to law, morals, good, customs, public order, or public policy, or upon a finding, based on a verified motion by any party, and after hearing, that the mediation proceeding or the preparation of the settlement agreement had been attended by fraud, mistake, violence or intimidation; or\n   * clarify the intentions of the parties if the court determines that the agreement or any portion thereof is vague, defective, or unenforceable, and direct them to amend the same accordingly.\n\nIn the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs (b) and (c), the court can decide whether to refer the case to JDR or proceed to trial instead of disapproving or amending the agreement.\n\nIf there is no settlement, the PMCU staff must send a Mediator’s Report to the court detailing the mediation’s outcome within the timeframe specified\n\nThe following circumstances will be considered a failure in CAM:\n\n * When the parties mediate in good faith but no agreement was reached by them despite the efforts exerted by the assigned mediator; or\n * When either one or both parties fail to appear after they have started to negotiate in a previous mediation conference wherein the mediator exerted efforts to assist the parties in settling their dispute.\n\n\nMediator’s Report\n\nThe PMCU staff and the assigned mediator would ensure that the Mediator’s Report is sent to the referring judge on schedule:\n\n * In case of settlement, after the signing of the compromise agreement;\n * In case any of the parties refuse to mediate, on the date of such refusal;\n * In case of refusal to settle before the end of the mediation period, after the parties indicate their desire to terminate the mediation proceeding; or\n * In case the parties fail to settle within the mediation period, after the lapse of the said period.\n\nThere is refusal to mediate when one or both parties:\n\n * Fail to show up for at least two consecutive mediation sessions;\n * Reject or fail to pay mediation fees; or\n * Refuse to engage in the mediation proceedings.\n\n\nDetermination of CAM Judgment\n\nTo differentiate them from decisions based on compromised agreements entered into during JDR, judgments approving the parties’ compromise agreements must include a statement that they were made by CAM. For documentation purposes, copies of said judgment must be submitted to PMCU.\n\n\nJudicial Dispute Resolution\n\nJudicial dispute resolution (JDR) is a procedure in which a judge (referred to as the JDR Judge) uses conciliation, mediation, or early neutral appraisal to settle a case before it goes to trial.\n\nNeutral or early neutral appraisal or evaluation is detailed in Article 7.6 Rule 2 of the IRR of RA 9285. It is an ADR process wherein parties and their lawyers are brought together early in the pre-trial phase to present summaries of their cases and to receive a non-binding assessment by an experienced neutral person, with expertise in the subject matter or substance of the dispute.\n\nWhen a referring judge receives a mediator’s report informing them that no settlement was reached during CAM, they must then decide whether a settlement is still possible in the hearing set for that reason and, if so, assign the case to the JDR judge.\n\nIn case of a partial settlement and the judge is convinced that settlement is still possible, the unsettled part of the dispute is referred to a JDR judge.\n\nIf JDR fails, the case will be heard and decided by another judge, known as the trial judge.\n\n\nCases Covered by JDR\n\n 1. All CAM cases, except for environmental cases, may be referred to JDR after failure to settle or refusal to mediate in CAM if the judge of the court in which the case was originally filed believes that settlement is still possible.\n 2. The cases listed below, which were brought on appeal from the first-level courts’ exclusive and original jurisdiction, in locations designated as JDR sites if the RTC judge believes a settlement is still feasible.\n    * All civil cases and settlement of an estate, testate and intestate;\n    * All cases of forcible entry and unlawful detainer;\n    * All civil cases involving title to, or possession of, real property or an interest therein;\n    * Habeas corpus cases decided by the first-level court in the absence of any RTC judge.\n\n\nDuration of JDR\n\nThe proceedings begin as soon as the referral order is issued and must be completed within a non-extendable period of fifteen (15) calendar days from obtaining the referral order.\n\nIf the parties fail to settle during the first JDR session and the time limit has not yet elapsed, the JDR judge will reschedule the case for another JDR session.\n\n\nQualification to Conduct JDR\n\nOnly judges who have undergone a skills-based training in Judicial Dispute Resolution are authorized to conduct JDR proceedings. They must also be stationed in JDR sites unless the judge is directed by the Supreme Court.\n\n\nConduct\n\nWhen no settlement is arrived at during CAM, the parties and their counsels must appear before the JDR judge on their scheduled session. The JDR judge will act as mediator, conciliator, and/or neutral evaluator who will actively assist and facilitate negotiations between the parties to settle their dispute.\n\nThe tasks of a neutral evaluator are to:\n\n * assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of each party’s case;\n * make a non-binding and impartial evaluation of the chances of each party’s success in the case; and\n * guide the parties to a fair and mutually acceptable settlement of their dispute.\n\nOnce a case is settled, the JDR judge must create the JDR Report and return the case to the judge for appropriate action.\n\nIf a full settlement is reached:\n\n * The parties, assisted by their counsels as needed, must draft a compromise agreement.\n * Submit the agreement to the judge to verify enforceability.\n\nIf a compromise agreement was fulfilled before being sent to the judge:\n\n * Instead of submitting a compromise agreement, a satisfaction of claims or mutual withdrawal of both parties must be submitted.\n * The judge will then issue an order declaring the case terminated.\n\nIn case the parties only arrived at a partial settlement:\n\n * The parties, as assisted by their counsels, must submit the terms to the judge for approval and rendition of judgment.\n * For the unsettled part of the dispute, the case will proceed to trial until judgement.\n\nShould there be no compromise reached:\n\n * The JDR judge must accomplish the JDR report and return the case to the judge.\n * The judge can then move forward with the case accordingly.\n\n\nSupplementary Information\n\n\nCases that Cannot be Subjected to Compromise Agreement\n\nThe following cases cannot be settled via compromise agreement, regardless of whether it is via CAM or JDR:\n\n 1. As previously mentioned, civil cases falling under Article 2035 of the New Civil Code.\n 2. Petitions for habeas corpus;\n 3. Special proceedings for probate of a will;\n 4. Cases with a pending application for restraining orders/preliminary injunctions.\n\nNote: The court shall refer the parties to mediation in cases covered by numbers 1 and 4 where the parties notify the court that they have agreed to attend mediation on certain aspects of the case, such as custody of minor children, property separation, or support pendente lite.\n\n\nReferral to CAM and JDR\n\nIn all other actions or proceedings where compromise is not legally prohibited and a reasonable probability of settlement exists, one or all of the parties may request the court to refer their dispute to CAM and JDR by oral manifestation or written motion after the preliminary conference, or at any stage of the proceedings, provided there are still factual problems to be settled.\n\n\nMediator Selection\n\nA Philippine Mediation Center Unit (PMCU) staff will assist the parties in manually selecting an appropriate mediator from the PMCU’s roster of mediators.\n\nIf the parties cannot agreed, the PMCU staff will choose one by lot among the available mediators at the unit in the presence of the parties.\n\nIf no mediator is in attendance at the unit, one will be selected by lot in the presence of the parties by the PMCU staff from a list of mediators.\n\n← Chapter 1: Fundamentals of Dispute Resolution\n\nChapter 3: Litigation →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-dispute_crises-3.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-15 07:06:36","updated_at":"2024-11-15 07:11:08","published_at":"2024-07-07 10:02:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-full-feature-image","canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6736f3adb56e7207e7270421","uuid":"020fbf5b-e6f3-4123-8341-c21c2c3804b5","title":"Additional Notes","slug":"additional-notes","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Civil Code of the Philippines\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h1\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Article 1814\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h2\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Art. 1814.

The mediators are drawn from volunteers in the barangay.\n\nAt its core, the idea of this system is to use traditional Filipino values when solving disputes, e.g. utang na loob, palabra de honor, hiya, etc. This is patterned after earlier dispute resolution systems.\n\nThe goals of the system are three-fold:\n\n * attain just, quick, and inexpensive dispute resolution at the barangay level\n * preserve Filipino cultures and traditions in the amicable settlement of disputes\n * ease the backlog in the courts\n\nThe Lupong Tagapamayapa, whose members include the barangay captain, as chairman, and 10 to 20 qualified residents of the same barangay, is the committee assigned to resolving local conflicts and other issues. While they may have the authority to hear and address grievances, they do not constitute a court as they do not possess judicial powers.\n\nThis program, similar to the ADR processes, was created to help decongest the courts and mostly functions as the main dispute resolution method at the village level.\n\nThis Lupon system is detailed under Chapter VII: Katarungang Pambarangay of RA 7160, otherwise known as the Local Goverment Code of 1991 approved on October 10, 1991.\n\n\nFunctions of the Lupon\n\n * Exercise administrative supervision over relevant conciliation panels;\n * Meet regularly once a month to provide a forum for exchange of ideas among its members and the public on matters relevant to the amicable settlement of disputes, and to enable various conciliation panel members to share with one another their observations and experiences in effecting speedy resolution of disputes; and,\n * Exercise other powers, duties, and functions as prescribed by law.\n\n\nPangkat ng Tagapagkasundo\n\nWhen a dispute is brought into the lupon, the disputing parties will create a pangkat from the members of the lupon who will help settle their dispute. The pangkat should be made of three members chosen by the disputing parties.\n\nIf the parties cannot agree regarding pangkat membership, then the members will be drawn by lots by the chairman of the lupon.\n\nThe three members will then elect from among themselves a chairman and a secretary. The latter is required to prepare the minutes of the proceedings as well as submit a copy duly attested by the chairman to the lupon secretary and to the proper city or municipal court. Notices should also be sent to the relevant parties.\n\nShould any member of the pangkat become unavailable or unable to continue, the parties will select a replacement from the remaining lupon members. If the parties fail to agree, one will be drawn by lot by the lupon chairman.\n\n\nSubject Matter, and Exceptions\n\nThe lupon of each barangay has the authority to gather all parties residing in the same city or municipality for the purpose of amicable settlement of all disputes except:\n\n * If one party is the government or part of it.\n * If one party is a public official and the dispute concerns the performance of their official functions.\n * Offenses punishable by imprisonment of more than one year or a fine exceeding ₱ 5,000.00.\n * When there is no private offended party.\n * When the dispute involves real property located in different cities or municipalities unless the parties agree to an amicable settlement.\n * When the parties involved live in different barangays belonging to different cities or municipalities unless the barangays are adjoined and the parties agree to an amicable settlement.\n * Other classes of dispute as deemed inappropriate for amicable resolution by the President or by recommendation of the Secretary of Justice.\n\n\nConduct\n\n\nVenue\n\nIf the disputing parties live in the same barangay, then their dispute must be brought for amicable settlement to the lupon of the same barangay.\n\nIf the disputing parties live in different barangays but in the same city or municipality, then their dispute must be brought to the lupon of the barangay where the respondent resides.\n\nIf the dispute involves real property, then it must be settled at the barangay of the same property or where a large portion of it is located.\n\nIf the dispute arose at a workplace or school, then the dispute must be brought to the lupon of the barangay where the workplace or school is located.\n\n\nProcedure\n\nAnyone who wishes to start an action against another person may state their complaint to the lupon chairman either orally or in writing after paying the appropriate filing fee.\n\nOnce the complaint is received, the lupon chairman should summon the respondent within the next working day. A notice will also be sent to the complainant asking them and their witnesses to appear for mediation.\n\nIf the chairman fails to settle the dispute within 15 days from the first meeting of the parties with them, a pangkat will be created for the case.\n\nThe pangkat will then have to meet within three days from the date of its creation. They will hear both parties and their witnesses, simplify the issues, and discover possible solutions. For the purposes of this meeting, the pangkat has the authority to issue summons to the involved parties.\n\nA party may move to disqualify a member of the pangkat for the following reasons:\n\n * relationship\n * bias\n * interest\n * other similar grounds\n\nThis motion will then be decided by majority decision of the pangkat.\n\nShould one be disqualified, they will be replaced accordingly.\n\nThe pangkat has 15 days from the first convention to resolve the dispute at hand. This deadline may be extended by the pangkat, but not for more than 15 days, unless the case is highly meritorious of further extension.\n\n\nForm of Settlement\n\nThe settlement should be:\n\n * in writing\n * in a language or dialect known to the parties\n * signed by both parties\n * attested to by the lupon chairman or the pangkat chairman\n\n\nInvolvement of Higher Entities\n\nNo case involving matters covered by the Barangay Justice System is permitted to reach the court or other similar government agencies without certification by the lupon secretary or the pangkat secretary, attested by the lupon chairman or the pangkat chairman, that no settlement was arrived upon locally or that the settlement was thrown out by both parties.\n\nHowever, the disputing parties may go directly to court given the following circumstances:\n\n * the accused is in detention\n * a person has been deprived of liberty and there is a call for habeas corpus proceedings\n * the actions are coupled with provisional remedies, e.g. preliminary injunction, attachment, delivery of personal property, support pendente lite\n\nMembers of indigenous cultural communities shall apply their customs and traditions regarding dispute resolution of their community members.\n\n\nArbitration\n\nIf the parties agree in writing, they may decide to proceed to arbitration and abide by the award of the lupon chairman or the pangkat. Such agreement may, however, be revoked within five (5) days of the institution of the agreement. The award must then be finalized within 10 days after the revocation period.\n\nThe award must be in writing and in a language or dialect known to both parties.\n\n\nNotes on the Proceedings\n\nKP proceedings are open to the public unless the pangkat decides or a party decides otherwise on the basis of privacy, decency, or public morals.\n\nThe parties are required to appear in person without counsel nor representative, except for minors and incompetents who may be assisted by their next-of-kin who are not lawyers.\n\nThe amicable settlement or award resulting from the proceedings will have the force and effect of a court judgment after ten (10) days from the date of closing, unless such has been repudiated or a petition to nullify was filed in the proper city or municipal court.\n\nA repudiation can be made within ten (10) days from the date of settlement by a filing a sworn statement with the lupon chairman that said settlement is unacceptable as it is corrupted by fraud, violence, or intimidation.\n\nThe settlement or award may be enforced by the lupon within six months from the date of settlement. Afterwards, it may be enforced by the appropriate city or municipal court.\n\nThe secretary of the lupon must submit the outcome of the proceedings to the city or municipal court within five days of the settlement or the lapse of the repudiation period. Copies must also be provided to the parties as well as the lupon chairman.\n\n← Chapter 3: Litigation\n\nChapter 5: Retributive Justice vs Restorative Justice →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-dispute_crises-6.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-15 07:13:58","updated_at":"2024-11-15 07:18:24","published_at":"2024-07-07 10:04:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-full-feature-image","canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6736f5e0b56e7207e7270459","uuid":"2009ecb5-bea4-47da-bbd1-a4df64d7bcee","title":"Retributive Justice vs Restorative Justice","slug":"retributive-justice-vs-restorative-justice","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Before we discuss different justice systems, let us first attempt to understand what justice is.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Justice\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is what the society has decided to be what \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":3,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"right\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\" is.

To be successful, they must be able to address all aspects of the crisis: diplomatic, political, military, humanitarian, economic, and social.</li><li><strong>Efficient Situation Awareness</strong>&nbsp;This refers to not only gaining awareness to current situations, but also learning to detect previously unknown threats and issues long before they occur. It also includes effectively conveying the appropriate warnings and providing enough preparation time to everyone involved.</li><li><strong>Tiered Response to Incidents</strong>&nbsp;Local government units must be empowered such that they are capable of answering to the challenges of any crisis that might occur in their community. However, higher levels of governance, including national level organizations must, at the same time, be prepared to support and sustain local efforts when necessary.</li><li><strong>Adaptable Operational Capabilities</strong>&nbsp;Crisis, by their nature, are unpredictable events. While protocols must be established to answer to different types of incidents, all of these protocols must be flexible enough so that they are adaptable to any unforeseen changes or complications that might occur in any situation.</li><li><strong>Unity of Effort Through Unity of Command</strong>&nbsp;All relevant agencies must have a clear mandate on their roles and responsibilities. At the same time, all members of these agencies must understand the roles and responsibilities of their counterparts in other agencies. A clear delineation of functions means that everyone knows what they are supposed to do and everyone knows what they can expect of everyone else.</li><li><strong>Readiness to Act</strong>&nbsp;Adequate response to an incident highly depends on the operatives’ willingness and ability to act on their duties. This must be engrained among First Responders and encouraged in the community. This may include readily taking command or being responsible for entire situations. Thus, people in leadership positions must be trained well enough such that they need not hesitate when the situation calls for them to act.</li><li><strong>Intensified Public Information Campaign</strong>&nbsp;A community that is aware of public safety protocols is better guarded against disasters.

While protocols must be established to answer to different types of incidents, all of these protocols must be flexible enough so that they are adaptable to any unforeseen changes or complications that might occur in any situation.\n * Unity of Effort Through Unity of Command All relevant agencies must have a clear mandate on their roles and responsibilities. At the same time, all members of these agencies must understand the roles and responsibilities of their counterparts in other agencies. A clear delineation of functions means that everyone knows what they are supposed to do and everyone knows what they can expect of everyone else.\n * Readiness to Act Adequate response to an incident highly depends on the operatives’ willingness and ability to act on their duties. This must be engrained among First Responders and encouraged in the community. This may include readily taking command or being responsible for entire situations. Thus, people in leadership positions must be trained well enough such that they need not hesitate when the situation calls for them to act.\n * Intensified Public Information Campaign A community that is aware of public safety protocols is better guarded against disasters. As such, relevant agencies must ensure that they are consistent in creating public information campaigns, education strategies, and communication plans in a timely and accessible manner.\n\nShould the government find itself in an extreme situation for which no statutes or policies are in place to handle said situation, the President is authorized to use their constitutional powers to protect the State and its people and maintain peace and order in the country or any part of it.\n\nThese principles are founded on the 1987 Philippine Constitutions, best practices in governance and, most importantly, our cultures and values.\n\n\nTypes of Critical Incidents\n\nThere are two general types of critical incidents: man-made crises and natural incidents.\n\n\nMan-Made Crises\n\nAs its name implies, man-made crises are critical incidents that happen due to the action, inaction, or failure of a man-made system.\n\nThese include:\n\n * Civil Disturbances These can refer to disruption in society caused by a group. The violent ones are referred to as civil disorders or civil unrest. These are acts of violence perpetuated by assemblies of three or more people and causing immediate danger or results in damage to property or injury to persons.\n   * Labor Strikes Temporary halt in a service or operation caused by a concerted action of a group of employees or a labor union\n   * Demonstrations March or gathering of people in opposition of or to show support for something\n   * Riots Tumultuous disturbance of public peace caused by an assembly of three or more people acting towards a common goal\n   * Anarchy General lawlessness and disorder generally resulting from a perceived absence or failure in government\n   * People’s Strikes Extended sympathetic strike that involves not only the workers or employees in a certain company or sector but also the community at large\n * Revolts Refusal of control or rule by an authority by using violent action\n   * Mutiny An act of defiance against a military authority done by two or more persons subject to said authority\n   * Insurrection An organized, generally violent act of rebellion against the government or a governing authority\n   * Coup d’Etat Sudden, violent overthrow of an existing government by a small group, starting with control of the armed forces, law enforcement entities, and other military elements\n * Revolutions Extra-constitutional attempt to replace one form of government with another to effect a fundamental change in governance\n * Border Incidents Territorial disputes over the division of land or water bodies\n * Wars Considerable hostile conflict between political groups for a significant duration and magnitude\n   * Conventional Wars Use of traditional means to wage war\n   * Biochemical Wars Warfare involving biological and chemical weaponry\n   * Nuclear Wars Considered the most dangerous weapons on earth, nuclear weapons are used in this type of war\n * Kidnappings Unlawful taking of a person against their will, usually through violence, force, threat, or intimidation\n * Hijackings Seizing control of a vehicle through threat or force\n * Hostage-Taking Incidents Holding a person or persons captive to be used as bargaining chips when demanding from authorities\n * Terrorist Activities Intimidating the public, cultivating an atmosphere of fear, provoking the government, destabilising the structures of a country, undermining public safety, etc. for whatever purpose the perpetrator supports (More details can be found in RA 11479 or The Anti-terrorism Act of 2020.)\n * Attacks or Raids Violent attacks on government installations and other vital facilities\n\n\nNatural Incidents\n\nNatural crises are critical incidents coming from natural hazards. They are generally beyond human control.\n\nThese include:\n\n * Fires\n * Marine Disasters\n * Air Disasters\n * Structural Collapse Failure of a structure of a component thereof to maintain its integrity\n * Hazardous Spills\n * Utilities Failure Unplanned malfunction of essential utility systems, including, but not limited to, electricity, water, and gas\n * Nuclear Accidents\n * Famine\n * Fuel Shortages\n * Pestilence Contagious disease that is virulent and devastating\n   * Sporadic Disease that occurs irregularly and infrequently\n   * Endemic Constant presence of a disease within a limited geographic area\n   * Hyperendemic Persistent, high level of disease occurrence\n   * Epidemic Increased, often sudden, disease incidence in a limited geographic area\n   * Outbreak Similar to an epidemic, but happens over a smaller area\n   * Cluster Aggregation of a greater number of cases in a specific place and time\n   * Pandemic An epidemic that has spread over a number of countries or continents and affecting a large number of people\n * Floods\n   * Minor Floodings\n   * Major Floodings\n   * Flash Floods\n * Volcanic Eruptions\n   * Lava Flow\n   * Tephra or Ash Fall\n   * Pyroclastic Density Currents\n   * Lateral Blast\n   * Volcanic Gas\n * Earthquakes\n   * Tectonic Earthquakes\n   * Volcanic Earthquakes\n * Tidal Waves\n * Tsunamis\n * Typhoons\n * Droughts\n\n\nPhases of Critical Incident Management\n\nTo better address crisis situations, the 5P Crisis Management Model was developed. This follows the three phases of crisis management: Proactive, Reactive, Post-Conflict.\n\nThe Proactive Phase is subdivided into three stages:\n\n * Predict As the name implies, this involves the identification of risks and threats present in the community so as to foretell the likelihood of the occurrence of a critical incident. Additionally, analysis of developing and reported incidents are conducted to help improve the prediction model.\n * Prepare This involves planning, organising, training, stockpiling of supplies, people, and equipment that could be needed during a crisis.\n * Prevent This refers to deliberate actions done to avoid the occurrence of a critical incident.\n\nShould any untoward incident occur despite the efforts done in the previous stage, the Reactive Phase is initiated and we move in Perform. During this stage, contingency plans and protocols are implemented to respond to the incident with the goal of saving lives, protecting property and the environment, as well as the preservation of social, economic, and political structures in the area.\n\nFinally, during the Post-Conflict Phase, Post-Action and Assessment is done. This can only happen when the situation has already cleared. In this phase, the community seeks to return to business as usual while evaluating the response and finding ways to improve prediction, preparation, prevention, and actual execution.\n\n← Chapter 5: Retributive Justice vs Restorative Justice\n\nChapter 7: Disaster Management Protocols →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-dispute_crises-8.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-15 07:28:53","updated_at":"2024-11-15 07:31:09","published_at":"2024-07-07 10:06:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-full-feature-image","canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"6736f8e3b56e7207e7270480","uuid":"b1140e11-66c3-4dc8-9fa0-2d7ac2fb1959","title":"Disaster Management Protocols","slug":"disaster-management-protocols","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In the Philippines, crisis response protocols are outlined in the various manuals of the different responsible agencies.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"type\":\"image\",\"version\":1,\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-01-critical_incident.jpg\",\"width\":1280,\"height\":720,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"critical incident\",\"caption\":\"\",\"cardWidth\":\"regular\",\"href\":\"\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Hostage-Taking Incidents\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"extended-heading\",\"version\":1,\"tag\":\"h1\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"hostage-taking \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"refers to the act of seizing individuals, often civilians, and holding them captive to achieve specific demands, such as ransom, political concessions, or the release of prisoners.

Cross,&nbsp;<strong>hostage-taking&nbsp;</strong>refers to the act of seizing individuals, often civilians, and holding them captive to achieve specific demands, such as ransom, political concessions, or the release of prisoners. It’s a coercive tactic often employed by individuals, groups, or organizations to exert pressure on authorities or to further their own agendas.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-02-hostage_taking.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"hostage-taking incident\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-02-hostage_taking.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-02-hostage_taking.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-02-hostage_taking.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"types-of-hostage-takers\">Types of Hostage-Takers</h2><ol><li><strong>Common Criminals</strong>&nbsp;People who take hostages for personal, rather than ideological reasons<ul><li>The common criminals will generally concede to police negotiations if there is no way out and hostages will generally be unharmed</li><li>This type is classified as a rational creative thinker, is able to reason, and can discriminate on how much force is to be used against him</li><li><strong>Reasons Why Common Criminals Take Hostages:</strong><ul><li>Escape</li><li>Money</li><li>Transportation</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Persons in Crisis</strong>&nbsp;People who take hostages during a period of prolonged frustration, despair and problems</li><li><strong>Psychotics</strong>&nbsp;Mentally-ill people who take hostages during a period of psychiatric<br>disturbance<ul><li>This person is unpredictable and may resort to violence depending on his mood</li><li>The enforcement officer should try to gain as much information as possible concerning motives. ex. past history, medical and arrest records, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Prisoners</strong>&nbsp;People who take hostages because of dissatisfaction and discontent<br>regarding their living conditions in prison</li><li><strong>Political Terrorists</strong>&nbsp;Ideologically-inspired individuals or groups of people who take<br>hostages because of political and ideological beliefs.</li><li><strong>Fanatics</strong><ul><li>They fall on the extreme side of violence</li><li>Considered most dangerous because the law, in his mind, has no legal basis</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id=\"managing-hostage-situations\">Managing Hostage Situations</h2><h3 id=\"predict\">Predict</h3><p>Here’s what will happen if you are taken hostage:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Remain calm, be polite, and cooperate with your captors.</li><li>DO NOT attempt escape unless there is an extremely good chance of survival. It is safer to be submissive and obey your captors.</li><li>Speak normally. DO NOT complain, avoid being belligerent, and comply with all orders and instructions.</li><li>DO NOT draw attention to yourself with sudden body movements, statements, comments, or hostile looks.</li><li>Observe the captors and try to memorize their physical traits, voice patterns, clothing, or other details that can help provide a description later.</li><li>Avoid getting into political or ideological discussions with your captors.</li><li>Try to establish a relationship with your captors and get to know them. Captors are less likely to harm you if they respect you.</li><li>If forced to present terrorist demands to authorities, either in writing or on tape, state clearly that the demands are from your captors. Avoid making a plea on your own behalf.</li><li>Try to stay low to the ground or behind cover from windows or doors, if possible.</li></ul><h3 id=\"prepare\">Prepare</h3><p>For individuals considering these threats, first think about the places you stay most often, like your home, workplace, gym, house or worship, or any other location you visit frequently. For each of these locations:</p><ul><li>Do you know all of the entrances and exits?</li><li>Do you know where emergency supplies are located?</li></ul><p>Next, consider how a potential attack could unfold and how you would respond:</p><ul><li>What is the most likely place an attacker would enter?</li><li>How would you escape if usual egress points are blocked?</li><li>What objects are present that could be used as a weapon, if it became necessary?</li><li>Do you carry a pocket knife or mace?</li><li>Are there areas where you could hide or barricade to put space between yourself and an intruder?&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 id=\"prevent\">Prevent</h3><p>By acting in a security-conscious way, you can reduce the risk of being taken hostage.&nbsp; This includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Avoid going into unsafe areas, especially on excursions. Be aware of any current situations in the area. Understand that risk levels can change, even over-night.&nbsp;</li><li>All criminals exploit opportunities and vulnerabilities. Observe your surroundings carefully, especially around your residence, your workplace and your car, as these might be where criminals approach you.</li><li>Be particularly attentive when dealing with unexpected callers to your home. Be on your guard with unexpected occurrences like apparent emergencies, traffic incidents or&nbsp;roadblocks, and with anyone approaching you to offer help. It might be a diversion or trap.</li><li>Watch out for individuals or vehicles following you. If you suspect you are being followed, you could drive to the local police station or to a place where you feel safe.</li><li>If you are abroad and you are not familiar with the places and everything, try not to be an attractive target. Wear clothing that will not draw attention and do not display any jewelry (including fakes), or have expensive vehicles, bags, suitcases, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>It is not your perception of wealth that counts, it is the view of the local population’s. Remember that your ethnicity/race may be enough to make you stand out.</li><li>Your full name, where you work, and your function should not be displayed on luggage, your car, doorplates or signs. Consider using your name only instead of the company’s for invoices, bookings and your credit card.</li><li>Prevent criminals from finding out anything that might make you their target. Be cautious about providing information about yourself on the Internet, e.g. in social networks. It can also be used as a source of information by criminals.</li><li>Predictable behavior makes it easy for criminals to spy on you and make plans.&nbsp;<ul><li>Vary the time you depart for, and return from, work.&nbsp;</li><li>Vary your route and take detours.</li><li>Vary the vehicle you take and where you park it.</li><li>Vary when and where you go to bars, clubs and restaurants.</li><li>Vary when and where you go to activities such as sports or meetings with friends.</li></ul></li><li>Your home should be well protected against unauthorized entry. New locks should be installed when you move in or if a key is lost. Never leave a key outside. Repair any defective lighting as soon as possible.</li><li>Choose a well-lit, easily overlooked, and attended car park. Avoid stopping next to occupied vehicles or vehicles you cannot see into (like delivery vans).&nbsp;</li><li>Do not approach your car if there are suspicious people loitering nearby or if your departure will be hindered, e.g. by another parked vehicle.</li></ul><h3 id=\"perform\">Perform</h3><p>In the tragic circumstance where a hostage-taking does occur, the following guidelines and procedures shall be undertaken:</p><ol><li><strong>First Responders (FR)&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Secure the incident scene and establish perimeter security.</li><li>Give situation update and inform the&nbsp;<strong>Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT)</strong>&nbsp;for possible deployment.</li><li>Do not allow unauthorized persons at the incident scene.</li><li>Gather information about the hostage-taker and hostage(s) from witnesses.</li><li>Re-route traffic flow if necessary.</li><li>Evacuate all persons within the vicinity of the incident scene.&nbsp;</li><li>Clear areas for use of other responders.&nbsp;</li><li>Establish&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Command Post (ACP)</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Initiate contact with the hostage-taker through any available means.</li><li>If the situation becomes volatile, request for deployment of HNT.</li><li>Brief the TL, HNT of the situation and turn- over the conduct of negotiation.</li><li>Stay at the incident scene to maintain security, crowd and traffic control, preserve evidence and take custody of witnesses</li></ul></li><li><strong>Incident Commander (IC)</strong><ul><li>The IC shall prepare necessary plans including but not limited to the following:<ul><li><strong>Emergency Response Plan</strong>&nbsp;Depends on the threat posed by the hostage-takers and need of the HNT and IC</li><li><strong>Breakout Plan</strong>&nbsp;possibility of breakout shall be considered immediately upon drawing up of negotiation strategy; this should be considered as one of the priority plans</li><li><strong>Delivery Plan&nbsp;</strong>In case the hostage-takers change plans in the middle of the execution</li><li><strong>Surrender Plan&nbsp;</strong>Shall be drawn up in a way that the hostages’ lives will not be jeopardized</li><li><strong>Hostage Reception/Release&nbsp;</strong>for security reasons, released hostages shall be contained and isolated</li><li><strong>Collection Plan</strong>&nbsp;Safety of the police personnel involved is the priority consideration.</li></ul></li><li>In handling hostage situations, the IC shall be guided by the following courses of actions:&nbsp;<ul><li>Negotiate</li><li>Arrest</li><li>Tactical assault</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT)</strong>&nbsp;The HNT shall:<ul><li>Set-up&nbsp;<strong>Negotiation Operation Center (NOC)</strong></li><li>Initiate contact with the hostage-taker and obtain other information</li><li>Give updates to the IC and brief him/her of the current situation</li><li>Evaluate the necessity of resorting to other option without compromising the safety of the hostage(s)</li><li>Recommend for activation of CMC and deployment of CIMTG as necessary</li><li>Facilitate all deliveries, hostage receptions, and release and possible surrender of hostage-taker</li><li>Attend to all meetings called by the CMC or IC.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Assault Team</strong>&nbsp;An assault team shall be alerted for deployment in case the negotiation fails.

They can range in size and can cause significant destruction. Earthquake crisis protocols include preparedness, response, search and rescue, medical care, damage assessment, and recovery and rehabilitation efforts. In the Philippines, agencies such as PHIVOLCS, NDRRMC, and LGUs play crucial roles in earthquake preparedness and response. Investigations into earthquakes involve seismic monitoring, studying tectonic settings, assessing ground effects, structural damage assessment, evaluating human impacts, analyzing response and recovery efforts, and identifying lessons learned. Collaboration between various disciplines and organizations is essential for effective earthquake preparedness, response, and investigation.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-03-earthquake.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"earthquake\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-03-earthquake.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-03-earthquake.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-03-earthquake.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Some of the hazard associated with earthquakes are:</p><ul><li>collapsing buildings and bridges</li><li>disruption of gas, electricity, and phone services</li><li>landslides and avalanches</li><li>flash floods, fires and tsunamis</li></ul><p>Key reasons why the Philippines is prone to earthquakes:</p><ul><li><strong>Seismic Activity&nbsp;</strong>The country experiences several earthquakes each year, ranging from minor tremors to destructive quakes due to the movement of the Earth’s plates.</li><li><strong>Fault Lines</strong>&nbsp;Major fault lines, such as the Philippine Fault Zone and the Valley Fault System, pose significant risks.</li></ul><h2 id=\"epcentr-project\">EPCEnTR Project</h2><p><strong>Achieving Public Safety and Security Thru “Earthquake Preparedness through Community Engagement and Training Response (EPCEnTR)” Project</strong></p><p>The commitment seeks to enhance public safety and security during earthquakes by engaging communities in planning, volunteer training, and capacity building.

The 2023 Global Risk Report also revealed that the top risk faced by the country in the next two years is natural disasters and extreme weather events.</p><p>Studies indicate that despite government efforts, household earthquake preparedness remains insufficient. Effective earthquake preparedness can mitigate devastating consequences. Factors such as perceived benefits, cues to action, and self-efficacy significantly influence preparedness levels. Increased awareness and understanding of the benefits of preparedness enhance people’s readiness for earthquakes and other disasters. Moreover, individuals with high self-efficacy feel more empowered to protect themselves and their families during disasters.</p><p><strong>Challenges in earthquake preparedness stem from various factors:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Lack of awareness and education</strong>&nbsp;Many community members may not fully grasp earthquake risks or the importance of preparedness due to limited access to accurate information.</li><li><strong>Complacency and low perceived risks</strong>&nbsp;Residents might underestimate earthquake likelihood and impact, especially in areas with infrequent seismic events, leading to a false sense of security.</li><li><strong>Language and cultural barriers</strong>&nbsp;Diverse communities face challenges in understanding preparedness information due to language barriers and differing cultural norms.</li><li><strong>Social and economic disparities</strong>&nbsp;Vulnerable populations struggle to access resources and information for preparedness due to economic challenges, leading to apathy towards preparedness efforts.</li><li><strong>Community dynamics and fragmentation</strong>&nbsp;Lack of cohesion and existing conflicts within communities hinder collaborative planning and response efforts.</li><li><strong>Communication and engagement strategies</strong>&nbsp;Ensuring effective communication to reach all segments of the community, including those with limited technology access, poses a challenge.</li><li><strong>Sustainability of engagement</strong>&nbsp;Maintaining long-term interest and engagement in preparedness activities is difficult without ongoing support and established mechanisms, especially when the perceived threat decreases over time.</li></ol><h3 id=\"prepare-1\">Prepare</h3><h4 id=\"ra-10121\">RA 10121</h4><p>Also known as the&nbsp;<strong>Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010</strong>, it was enacted on February 1, 2010.

Orientation programs, led by MCDRM or in-house lecturers, will emphasize the distinctive impacts of earthquakes and highlight available response plans. The project aims to promote preparedness by encouraging residents to prepare emergency kits, develop evacuation plans, and identify safe locations during earthquakes.</li><li><strong>Development of Barangay-Specific Response Plans and Safety Protocols</strong>&nbsp;The initiative involves creating barangay-specific emergency response plans for earthquake preparedness. These plans designate resident roles, evacuation sites, and coordination channels among authorities and communities. It includes establishing earthquake action and communication hubs (EACH) teams, neighborhood watch groups, and community emergency response teams (CERTs). Support networks among neighbors are encouraged for post-earthquake aid. Effective communication channels and household emergency protocols are essential components.</li><li><strong>Intensive Role-Specific Trainings</strong>&nbsp;Following the strategic assignment of specific roles to individuals or groups, intensive role-specific training will be provided to address the skills and competency requirements for earthquake response. Existing community groups and roles will be considered for integration of additional duties during disasters. Training programs will be identified and customized based on participants’ educational backgrounds, experience, and existing skills. Assessments will be conducted to measure the positive transfer of learning and improvements in skills and competencies, facilitating future upskilling efforts.</li></ol><h3 id=\"perform-1\">Perform</h3><p><strong>Earthquake Drills and Simulation</strong></p><p>Area-specific earthquake drills are essential for practicing preparedness and response strategies outlined in Barangay-Specific Response Plans. These drills emphasize immediate safety measures, emergency response, and communication protocols. By simulating earthquake scenarios, individuals can understand the importance of preparedness and rehearse appropriate actions. Moreover, drills facilitate the evaluation of community preparedness and identification of gaps, enabling proactive<br>measures to address deficiencies.</p><h3 id=\"post-action-and-assessment-1\">Post-Action and Assessment</h3><h4 id=\"capacity-development-program-on-crises-management-safety-assessment-search-and-rescue-reporting-and-documentation\">Capacity Development Program on Crises Management, Safety Assessment, Search and Rescue, Reporting and Documentation</h4><p>The community members need to be trained in safety assessment, search and rescue operations, and reporting and documentation following an earthquake. In many instances, external assistance may not immediately reach affected areas due to inaccessibility. Therefore, empowering residents through capacity development programs is essential. These initiatives aim to promote citizen-led actions and initiatives post-earthquake. Capacitation efforts will also include training residents in search and rescue operations and disaster victim identification to enhance local response capabilities.</p><h4 id=\"akap-ako-kapwa-at-pamayanan-kanlungan\">AKAP (Ako, Kapwa, at Pamayanan) Kanlungan</h4><p>After a catastrophic earthquake, communities face destruction, displacement, injuries, loss of life, and mental trauma. To prepare for such events, communities identify the safest convergence location during the preparedness phase. An initiative called “AKAP Kanlungan” is established as a community-led effort to construct temporary shelters for earthquake survivors. These shelters are built using available indigenous and scrap materials and are gradually stockpiled with resources from various sources in anticipation of disasters. The construction of AKAP Kanlungan symbolizes community resilience and serves as a statement of hope for recovery and overcoming challenges after the earthquake.</p><h4 id=\"provision-for-rehabilitation-and-recovery-plan\">Provision for Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan</h4><p>Rehabilitation and recovery after an earthquake are vital for restoring normalcy and aiding affected individuals, communities, and areas in overcoming physical, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. To prepare, mechanisms for facilitating rehabilitation and recovery will be formulated and integrated into barangay-specific action plans. These will involve a combination of short-term emergency response and long-term rebuilding efforts, addressing areas such as employment, livelihoods, infrastructure, lifeline facilities, housing, and resettlement, among others.</p><h2 id=\"responsible-agencies\">Responsible Agencies</h2><p>In the Philippines, several agencies play crucial roles in earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>National Disaster Response Plan&nbsp;</strong>is the Government of the Philippines’&nbsp;<strong><em>multihazard</em></strong>&nbsp;response plan.</p><p>Emergency management, as defined in the NDRRM Act of 2010 (RA 10121), is the organization and management of resources to address all aspects or phases of the emergency, mitigation of, preparedness for, response to and recovery from a disaster or emergency. It outlines the processes and mechanisms to facilitate a coordinated response by the national and/or at the local level departments/agencies. Local government institutions are responsible for the development and improvement of local response plans relative to their areas of responsibility and underlying risks.</p><h3 id=\"phivolcs\">PHIVOLCS</h3><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology</strong>&nbsp;(PHIVOLCS) is a service institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is principally mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunami and other related geotectonic phenomena.</p><p>Their responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Predicting the occurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and their related geotectonic phenomena</li><li>Determining how eruptions and earthquakes occur and also areas likely to be affected</li><li>Generating sufficient data for forecasting volcanic eruptions and earthquakes</li><li>Mitigating hazards of volcanic activities through appropriate detection, forecast and warning system</li><li>Formulating appropriate disaster preparedness plans</li></ul><h3 id=\"dost\">DOST</h3><p>The Department of Science and Technology (DOST) plays a significant role in supporting earthquake preparedness initiatives through its various programs and projects.

They ensure that health facilities are prepared to handle an influx of patients and provide medical teams to respond to emergencies in affected areas.</p><h1 id=\"fires\">Fires</h1><p>Fire is the oxidization of any material that results in the release of heat, light, and other reaction products. For the oxidative process to become fire, the chemical reaction must be rapid. This is the process of combustion.</p><p>The visible part of the fire is called the&nbsp;<strong><em>flame</em></strong>. The color of the flame will change according to the materials burning and the environment in which the fire is happening. You can also deliberately change the color of the flame by adding different materials to the fire.</p><p>Uncontrolled fire can be destructive, spreading as they grow and consuming the evidence of their initiation. Many fires can be prevented through public education — for instance, educating people on safe practices for using room heaters or other gas and electric devices.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-04-fire.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"building on fire\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-04-fire.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-04-fire.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-04-fire.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><h2 id=\"types-of-fire-according-to-burning-materials\">Types of Fire According to Burning Materials</h2><ul><li><strong>Class A</strong>&nbsp;Involves ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, and plastics</li><li><strong>Class B</strong>&nbsp;Involves flammable liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, grease and oil</li><li><strong>Class C</strong>&nbsp;Involves energized electrical equipment such as appliances, wiring, and transformers</li><li><strong>Class D</strong>&nbsp;Involves combustible metals or metallic alloy elements with combustible metal components</li><li><strong>Class K</strong>&nbsp;Involves cooking oils and fats, typically found in commercial kitchens; also called&nbsp;<strong><em>kitchen fires</em></strong></li></ul><h2 id=\"fire-safety-tips\">Fire Safety Tips</h2><p>One of the most common emergencies experienced by Filipinos is a fire in their home. In the Philippines, house fires are most likely to occur between March and April.</p><p>Home fires can be preventable. The following are simple steps that each of us can take to prevent a tragedy.</p><p><strong>Before</strong></p><ul><li>Place the phone numbers of the nearest fire station in your phone.</li><li>Eliminate combustible materials through good housekeeping.</li><li>Keep matches out of children’s reach.</li><li>Oil lamps, gas lamps, and candles should be placed away from curtains. Put out flames before going to bed.</li><li>Do not keep flammable materials like disinfectant spray, bleach gasoline, alcohol and paint inside the house.</li><li>Regularly check your electrical installations.</li><li>Do not overload electrical circuits.</li><li>Blown fuses should not be replaced with wires or any metal.</li><li>Never leave a lit cigarette or cigar on pipe unattended.</li><li>Always have a handy first aid kit.</li></ul><p>When cooking:</p><ul><li>Stay in the kitchen when you are frying, grilling or broiling food.</li><li>Turn off the stove if you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time.</li><li>Wear short, close-fitting or tightly rolled sleeves when cooking.</li><li>Keep a fire extinguisher available.</li><li>Frayed wires can cause fires. Replace all worn, old or damage appliance cords immediately and do not run cords under rugs or furniture.</li><li>Don’t overload extension cords and outlets.</li></ul><p><strong>During</strong></p><p>If a fire breaks out in your home, call the nearest fire station immediately. Some important fire safety tips on which you must act immediately until help arrives include:</p><ul><li>If you encounter a small fire:<ul><li>First, stay calm and don’t panic.</li><li>Don’t waste time saving your valuables.</li><li>Don’t shout “FIRE” when you try to wake anyone in your house who may be asleep.</li><li>Check closed doors for heat before you open them. If the door is hot, DO NOT open it. This means that the door is holding the fire back and opening it would allow the fire to spread.</li><li>Use any available fire extinguisher. Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire. If there’s no fire extinguisher, an alternative one will do so; pour a large quantity of salt or baking soda over the fire.</li></ul></li><li>If trapped in a room:<ul><li>Stay low in case of smoke or fumes. If you’re in bed, roll off your bed and crawl to the door.</li><li>Put a wet cloth under closed doors to help prevent the spread of smoke.</li><li>If you need to break a window to crawl out, use a chair or a drawer, or a similar hard object. Throw a pillow or blanket over the windowsill to protect yourself from broken glass while crawling out.</li></ul></li><li>If caught in smoke or fumes:<ul><li>If your clothing catches fire, stop where you are. Immediately drop to the ground and cover your mouth and face with your hands to protect them from flames. Roll over to smother the fire.</li><li>Keep your head down and close your eyes as often as possible. Hold your breath as much as possible to avoid being suffocated.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>AFTER</strong></p><p>The following will help you manage the situation:</p><ul><li>Listen to fire service advice. It’s part of their response to advise you on what to do next, in terms of recovering from the damage caused by the fire.</li><li>Only re-enter your home once you’ve been advised to do so by authorized officials.</li><li>Do not attempt to reconnect utilities yourself. Let the authorities check if the facilities are either safe to use or are better off being disconnected before they leave the site.</li><li>If there is any recovered food, make sure that it’s safe. Discard any food that may have been exposed to heat, smoke, or soot.</li></ul><h2 id=\"fire-response-protocols\">Fire Response Protocols</h2><p>In the Philippines, fire incidents are typically addressed following established protocols and guidelines to ensure an organized and effective response. Some key protocols regarding fire incidents in the Philippines include:</p><ol><li><strong>Local Government Coordination</strong>&nbsp;Local government units play a crucial role in coordinating fire response efforts within their jurisdictions. They work closely with the BFP and local fire departments to ensure a coordinated and efficient response.</li><li><strong>Fire Safety and Prevention</strong>&nbsp;In addition to response protocols, there is an emphasis on fire safety and prevention measures in the Philippines. This includes conducting fire drills, enforcing fire safety regulations, and promoting public awareness of fire hazards. By following these protocols and guidelines, authorities aim to minimize the impact of fire incidents on lives, properties, and the environment in the Philippines.</li></ol><h3 id=\"when-fires-happen\">When Fires Happen</h3><p>The following are enacted during critical fire incidents:</p><ol><li><strong>Detection and Reporting&nbsp;</strong>The first step is the detection of a fire either by individuals or through automated fire alarm systems. Upon detecting a fire, it should be immediately reported to the local fire department or emergency services by calling the designated emergency hotline number.</li><li><strong>Dispatch of Emergency Services</strong>&nbsp;Once a fire is reported, the local fire department dispatches firefighters, fire trucks, and other necessary resources to the location of the fire.</li><li><strong>Evacuation and Rescue</strong>&nbsp;If the fire poses a threat to life or property, residents or occupants of the affected building or area are evacuated to safety. Firefighters also conduct search and rescue operations to ensure that everyone is accounted for and safely removed from the premises.</li><li><strong>Fire Suppression and Control</strong>&nbsp;Firefighters work to contain and extinguish the fire using firefighting equipment, such as hoses, water pumps, fire extinguishers, and specialized tools. They also create barriers to prevent the fire from spreading to neighboring buildings or areas.</li><li><strong>Coordination with Other Agencies</strong>&nbsp;During larger incidents, coordination between the BFP, LGU’s, PNP, DOH, and other relevant agencies is essential to manage the response effectively. Each agency has a specific role to play in ensuring a comprehensive and coordinated effort.</li><li><strong>Investigation and Documentation</strong>&nbsp;After the fire is extinguished, an investigation is conducted to determine the cause of the fire. This information is crucial for prevention strategies and future planning. Documentation of the incident, including damage assessments and reports, is also carried out.</li></ol><h3 id=\"general-fire-response-procedure\">General Fire Response Procedure</h3><figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lesson 3.2 Firefighting, Part 1: Firefighting Operations\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LB2MxwDLP24?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; max-width: 100%; inset: 0px; height: 795.167px; position: absolute; width: 1060.22px;\"></iframe></figure><ol><li><strong>Pre-Fire Planning</strong>&nbsp;The development of a systematic course of action that may be performed to realize the objectives of fire protection; the process of establishing an SOP for when a fire breaks out</li><li><strong>Evaluation</strong>&nbsp;On-the-spot planning or sizing-up the situation. This is the process of knowing the emergency situation. It involves mental a evaluation by the operation officer-in-charge to determine the appropriate course of action that provides the highest probability of success. Evaluation of the situation is done by:<ul><li>Learning the facts of the situation by answering the 5 W’s and 1H</li><li>Understanding the probabilities of fatal behavior of fire</li><li>Knowing your own situation or capabilities, weaknesses and strengths, available manpower and equipment, etc.</li><li>Determining the appropriate course of action</li></ul></li><li><strong>Entry</strong>&nbsp;This is the process of accessing the burning structure.

when magma, gas, and ash are expelled from a volcano. These eruptions can vary in size and intensity, ranging from small lava flows to explosive eruptions that release ash and volcanic gases into the atmosphere. The impact of a volcanic eruption can be widespread and devastating, affecting the surrounding environment, communities, and infrastructure.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-06-volcanic_eruption.jpg\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"volcanic eruptions\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-06-volcanic_eruption.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-06-volcanic_eruption.jpg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/graphic-dispute_crises-07-06-volcanic_eruption.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 720px) 720px\"></figure><p>Volcanic eruptions are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth’s surface. When magma rises to the surface, it can result in an eruption. Other factors, such as the composition of the magma and the presence of gases, can also influence the type and intensity of the eruption.</p><p>Volcanic eruptions can pose various hazards, including lava flows, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving clouds of hot gas and ash), ashfall, volcanic gases, lahars (mudflows), and volcanic earthquakes. These hazards can impact the environment, infrastructure, and human health.</p><p>Scientists use various methods to monitor volcanic activity and predict potential eruptions. This includes seismometers to detect earthquakes, gas sensors to measure volcanic gases, and satellite imagery to track changes in the volcano’s surface. Early warning systems are crucial for alerting communities at risk.</p><p>To mitigate the impact of volcanic eruptions, authorities implement preparedness measures such as developing evacuation plans, establishing emergency shelters, and conducting public awareness campaigns. Crisis management plans are essential for coordinating response efforts and ensuring the safety of residents.</p><p>The aftermath of a volcanic eruption can have long-term effects on the environment, agriculture, economy, and public health.

It’s a coercive tactic often employed by individuals, groups, or organizations to exert pressure on authorities or to further their own agendas.\n\n\nTypes of Hostage-Takers\n\n 1. Common Criminals People who take hostages for personal, rather than ideological reasons\n    * The common criminals will generally concede to police negotiations if there is no way out and hostages will generally be unharmed\n    * This type is classified as a rational creative thinker, is able to reason, and can discriminate on how much force is to be used against him\n    * Reasons Why Common Criminals Take Hostages:\n      * Escape\n      * Money\n      * Transportation\n 2. Persons in Crisis People who take hostages during a period of prolonged frustration, despair and problems\n 3. Psychotics Mentally-ill people who take hostages during a period of psychiatric\n    disturbance\n    * This person is unpredictable and may resort to violence depending on his mood\n    * The enforcement officer should try to gain as much information as possible concerning motives. ex. past history, medical and arrest records, etc.\n 4. Prisoners People who take hostages because of dissatisfaction and discontent\n    regarding their living conditions in prison\n 5. Political Terrorists Ideologically-inspired individuals or groups of people who take\n    hostages because of political and ideological beliefs.\n 6. Fanatics\n    * They fall on the extreme side of violence\n    * Considered most dangerous because the law, in his mind, has no legal basis\n\n\nManaging Hostage Situations\n\n\nPredict\n\nHere’s what will happen if you are taken hostage: \n\n * Remain calm, be polite, and cooperate with your captors.\n * DO NOT attempt escape unless there is an extremely good chance of survival. It is safer to be submissive and obey your captors.\n * Speak normally. DO NOT complain, avoid being belligerent, and comply with all orders and instructions.\n * DO NOT draw attention to yourself with sudden body movements, statements, comments, or hostile looks.\n * Observe the captors and try to memorize their physical traits, voice patterns, clothing, or other details that can help provide a description later.\n * Avoid getting into political or ideological discussions with your captors.\n * Try to establish a relationship with your captors and get to know them. Captors are less likely to harm you if they respect you.\n * If forced to present terrorist demands to authorities, either in writing or on tape, state clearly that the demands are from your captors. Avoid making a plea on your own behalf.\n * Try to stay low to the ground or behind cover from windows or doors, if possible.\n\n\nPrepare\n\nFor individuals considering these threats, first think about the places you stay most often, like your home, workplace, gym, house or worship, or any other location you visit frequently. For each of these locations:\n\n * Do you know all of the entrances and exits?\n * Do you know where emergency supplies are located?\n\nNext, consider how a potential attack could unfold and how you would respond:\n\n * What is the most likely place an attacker would enter?\n * How would you escape if usual egress points are blocked?\n * What objects are present that could be used as a weapon, if it became necessary?\n * Do you carry a pocket knife or mace?\n * Are there areas where you could hide or barricade to put space between yourself and an intruder? \n\n\nPrevent\n\nBy acting in a security-conscious way, you can reduce the risk of being taken hostage.  This includes: \n\n * Avoid going into unsafe areas, especially on excursions. Be aware of any current situations in the area. Understand that risk levels can change, even over-night. \n * All criminals exploit opportunities and vulnerabilities. Observe your surroundings carefully, especially around your residence, your workplace and your car, as these might be where criminals approach you.\n * Be particularly attentive when dealing with unexpected callers to your home. Be on your guard with unexpected occurrences like apparent emergencies, traffic incidents or roadblocks, and with anyone approaching you to offer help. It might be a diversion or trap.\n * Watch out for individuals or vehicles following you. If you suspect you are being followed, you could drive to the local police station or to a place where you feel safe.\n * If you are abroad and you are not familiar with the places and everything, try not to be an attractive target. Wear clothing that will not draw attention and do not display any jewelry (including fakes), or have expensive vehicles, bags, suitcases, etc. \n * It is not your perception of wealth that counts, it is the view of the local population’s. Remember that your ethnicity/race may be enough to make you stand out.\n * Your full name, where you work, and your function should not be displayed on luggage, your car, doorplates or signs. Consider using your name only instead of the company’s for invoices, bookings and your credit card.\n * Prevent criminals from finding out anything that might make you their target. Be cautious about providing information about yourself on the Internet, e.g. in social networks. It can also be used as a source of information by criminals.\n * Predictable behavior makes it easy for criminals to spy on you and make plans. \n   * Vary the time you depart for, and return from, work. \n   * Vary your route and take detours.\n   * Vary the vehicle you take and where you park it.\n   * Vary when and where you go to bars, clubs and restaurants.\n   * Vary when and where you go to activities such as sports or meetings with friends.\n * Your home should be well protected against unauthorized entry. New locks should be installed when you move in or if a key is lost. Never leave a key outside. Repair any defective lighting as soon as possible.\n * Choose a well-lit, easily overlooked, and attended car park. Avoid stopping next to occupied vehicles or vehicles you cannot see into (like delivery vans). \n * Do not approach your car if there are suspicious people loitering nearby or if your departure will be hindered, e.g. by another parked vehicle.\n\n\nPerform\n\nIn the tragic circumstance where a hostage-taking does occur, the following guidelines and procedures shall be undertaken:\n\n 1. First Responders (FR) \n    * Secure the incident scene and establish perimeter security.\n    * Give situation update and inform the Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT) for possible deployment.\n    * Do not allow unauthorized persons at the incident scene.\n    * Gather information about the hostage-taker and hostage(s) from witnesses.\n    * Re-route traffic flow if necessary.\n    * Evacuate all persons within the vicinity of the incident scene. \n    * Clear areas for use of other responders. \n    * Establish Advanced Command Post (ACP). \n    * Initiate contact with the hostage-taker through any available means.\n    * If the situation becomes volatile, request for deployment of HNT.\n    * Brief the TL, HNT of the situation and turn- over the conduct of negotiation.\n    * Stay at the incident scene to maintain security, crowd and traffic control, preserve evidence and take custody of witnesses\n 2. Incident Commander (IC)\n    * The IC shall prepare necessary plans including but not limited to the following:\n      * Emergency Response Plan Depends on the threat posed by the hostage-takers and need of the HNT and IC\n      * Breakout Plan possibility of breakout shall be considered immediately upon drawing up of negotiation strategy; this should be considered as one of the priority plans\n      * Delivery Plan In case the hostage-takers change plans in the middle of the execution\n      * Surrender Plan Shall be drawn up in a way that the hostages’ lives will not be jeopardized\n      * Hostage Reception/Release for security reasons, released hostages shall be contained and isolated\n      * Collection Plan Safety of the police personnel involved is the priority consideration.\n    * In handling hostage situations, the IC shall be guided by the following courses of actions: \n      * Negotiate\n      * Arrest\n      * Tactical assault\n 3. Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT) The HNT shall:\n    * Set-up Negotiation Operation Center (NOC)\n    * Initiate contact with the hostage-taker and obtain other information\n    * Give updates to the IC and brief him/her of the current situation\n    * Evaluate the necessity of resorting to other option without compromising the safety of the hostage(s)\n    * Recommend for activation of CMC and deployment of CIMTG as necessary\n    * Facilitate all deliveries, hostage receptions, and release and possible surrender of hostage-taker\n    * Attend to all meetings called by the CMC or IC.\n 4.

The safe release of the hostage;\n 2. Arrest of the perpetrators;\n 3. Minimize harm to both the hostage and the hostage-takers; and\n 4. Minimize damage to properties.\n\nReasons\n\n 1. Peaceful resolution of incident;\n 2. Safe release of hostages;\n 3. Tactical team need time to prepare\n\nStages\n\n 1. Preliminary Stage\n 2. Opening\n 3. Exploratory\n 4. Conclusion\n\nProcedure\n\n 1. Situation must be stabilized first before the start of the negotiation.\n 2. All attempts to negotiate must be done by remote means.\n 3. Adherence to the basic policy on safety of the hostage shall be paramount.\n 4. Provide relevant information to the tactical teams.\n 5. All communication with the hostage-taker must be secured and protected.\n 6. Always adhere to the ethics of negotiation.\n\nProcess\n\n 1. Preparation\n    * Collection of relevant information\n    * Setting of goals\n    * Planning of initial stance\n    * Prepare back up and bottom line positions\n    * Ready answers and solutions\n 2. Drawing up Negotiation Strategy\n    * Assessment on what to do when both parties do not reach an agreement;\n    * Assessment on what the other party will do if they do not reach an agreement with the\n      negotiator;\n    * Assessment on the true issues in the negotiation;\n    * Assessment on the bargaining issue; and\n    * Assessment on the existence of trade-offs.\n 3. The Negotiation Proper\n    * All of the players should be clear with their interests and demands.\n    * Identify and acknowledge all conflicts and issues which need to be resolved.\n    * Agree on a common goal from the agreement.\n    * Bargain for a better deal.\n    * Trade concessions\n    * Try to resolve the issues and problems of all those concerned\n    * Compromise\n    * Conclude with a formal or written agreement\n\nUseful Negotiation Tactics\n\n * Establish and Maintain Communication\n   * problem-solving climate show desire to understand\n   * climate of compromise adopt give and lake attitude and by showing a willingness to bargain and yield when necessary.\n * Stall for Time\n   * reduce the stress environment\n   * allow for negotiations external to the conflict zone.\n   * permit the implementation of active hostage rescue efforts.\n * Obtain Information\n   * The negotiator can use open-ended or close ended questions depending on the initial reactions of the hostage-takers.\n   * In restatement of content, the negotiator must repeat in his own words what he thinks he has heard.\n   * In reflection of feeling the negotiator must pay attention to what is said and how it was said.\n * Calm the Hostage-Takers Using:\n   * Modelling The negotiator must talk and respond in a calm and controlled manner using a very conversational tone.\n   * Ventilation Give the hostage-takers time to talk without interrupting them.\n   * Distraction Use this to draw the attention of the hostage-takers away from whatever is bothering them.\n * Establish rapport.\n * Use Persuasion:\n   * Deal with small issues first thus creating an atmosphere of success.\n   * Maintain non-threatening communications, both verbal and non-verbal.\n   * Agree with obvious reluctance to any demands that might be to your tactical advantage. If the demands are to the advantage of the hostage-takers or fall in the area of non-negotiable items, stall for time and express willingness to seek alternative solutions.\n\nArrest\n\n 1. Effect the arrest of the hostage-taker when situation warrants.\n 2. Restrain the hostage-taker and conduct thorough search on his/her body and the immediate vicinity of the incident scene.\n 3. Inform the arrested person of the circumstances of his/ her arrest, and recite the Miranda warning, and anti-torture warning.\n 4. All evidence must be secured and properly documented.\n 5. Use reasonable force in arresting the hostage-taker.\n 6. Facilitate the transport of the hostage-taker to the nearest police station.\n\nTactical Assault\n\n 1. It may be resorted to if the hostage-taker poses imminent danger of causing death or injury to the negotiator or hostage.\n 2. When all peaceful means were utilized and failed and the hostage-taker is determined to become more violent.\n 3. When peaceful resolution of the incident becomes impossible.\n\n\nPost-Action and Assessment\n\nAfter a hostage-taking incident, some agencies such as PNP, LGU, POC, and AFP typically conducts post-conflict or assessment approaches to evaluate the incident, identify lessons learned, and improve crisis response strategies. Some of these approaches may include:\n\n * Incident Debriefing\n * Critical Incident Review\n * Stakeholder Consultation\n * Victim and Witness Support\n * Community Engagement\n * Policy Procedure Review\n * Training and Capacity Building\n\n\nEarthquakes\n\nEarthquakes are the shaking of the Earth’s surface caused by the sudden release of energy in the Earth’s lithosphere. They can range in size and can cause significant destruction. Earthquake crisis protocols include preparedness, response, search and rescue, medical care, damage assessment, and recovery and rehabilitation efforts. In the Philippines, agencies such as PHIVOLCS, NDRRMC, and LGUs play crucial roles in earthquake preparedness and response. Investigations into earthquakes involve seismic monitoring, studying tectonic settings, assessing ground effects, structural damage assessment, evaluating human impacts, analyzing response and recovery efforts, and identifying lessons learned. Collaboration between various disciplines and organizations is essential for effective earthquake preparedness, response, and investigation.\n\nSome of the hazard associated with earthquakes are:\n\n * collapsing buildings and bridges\n * disruption of gas, electricity, and phone services\n * landslides and avalanches\n * flash floods, fires and tsunamis\n\nKey reasons why the Philippines is prone to earthquakes:\n\n * Seismic Activity The country experiences several earthquakes each year, ranging from minor tremors to destructive quakes due to the movement of the Earth’s plates.\n * Fault Lines Major fault lines, such as the Philippine Fault Zone and the Valley Fault System, pose significant risks.\n\n\nEPCEnTR Project\n\nAchieving Public Safety and Security Thru “Earthquake Preparedness through Community Engagement and Training Response (EPCEnTR)” Project\n\nThe commitment seeks to enhance public safety and security during earthquakes by engaging communities in planning, volunteer training, and capacity building. Its goal is to minimize the impact of earthquakes on human lives, infrastructure, and communities. By promoting risk awareness and showcasing the bayanihan Filipino culture, the project aims to strengthen preparedness, response, mitigation, and continuity of life in the event of a catastrophic earthquake.\n\n(While the country has robust disaster risk management policies and task structures in place, there’s a notable gap in community involvement, mainly due to insufficient grassroots collaboration. On the other hand, civil society organizations (CSOs) and citizens have established partnerships with communities and can readily mobilize participatory efforts. To bridge this gap and enhance grassroots engagement, the commitment proposes collaboration with CSOs. Together, they aim to empower residents in high-risk areas, enabling them to become capable and self-reliant in times of disaster.)\n\n\nPrecautionary Measures\n\n\nBefore an Earthquake\n\n * Survey your home and workplace for potential hazards and take steps to mitigate them.\n * Prepare household emergency kits with essential supplies, ensuring they are well-stocked and up-to-date.\n * Develop a family emergency plan that includes evacuation routes, meeting points, and contact information. Distribute emergency plan cards to each family member.\n * Make copies of important documents such as identification, insurance policies, and medical records, and keep them in a secure place.\n * Educate yourself about earthquake risks and preparedness measures to enhance your readiness.\n * Stay informed by regularly checking for the latest news and alerts regarding earthquakes and other potential hazards in your area.\n * Make note of the location of fire extinguishers and emergency supplies in your area.\n * Identify what equipment you should shut down to reduce potential hazards when safe to do so.\n * Look around your area and decide where the safe spots are located; e.g., under sturdy tables, desks or against inside walls.\n * Always store flammable and hazardous chemicals in secondary containment trays and in approved cabinets.\n * Keep breakables and heavy objects on lower shelves whenever possible so they do not fall and injure someone.\n * Ensure seismic restraints and latches on shelves and cabinets are secured.\n * Secure valuable equipment, process tanks, storage tanks, gas cylinders, closets, and materials to prevent loss.\n * Familiarize yourself with the location of your Emergency Assembly Point (EAP).\n\n\nDuring an Earthquake\n\nIf you are inside:\n\n * Immediately “duck, cover, and hold”\n   * Under a desk, table or chair\n   * Between seating rows in classrooms\n   * Against a corridor wall\n * Stay inside the building and remain calm.\n * If you cannot find sturdy shelter, drop to the floor against an interior wall and cover your head and neck with your arms.\n * If you are in bed when the earthquake occurs, stay there and protect your head and neck with pillows and blankets.\n * Do not go into a doorway.\n * Move away from the danger areas: near windows, hanging objects, tall unsecured furniture (bookcases, cabinets, and appliances), and research or process equipment containing hazardous chemicals. Most casualties in earthquakes result from falling materials.\n * Stay inside under cover until shaking stops\n * Watch for falling objects\n * As you leave the area, and if safe to do so, turn off and disconnect power to equipment containing hazardous materials unless needed to keep process or experiment safe\n * Make note of any unsafe conditions, trapped personnel or other hazards to be reported when you evacuate to your EAP.\n\nIf you are outside:\n\n * Stay outside\n * Move to an open area away from buildings, trees, electrical/overhead wires, and other hazards\n * If forced to stand near a building, watch for falling objects\n\nIf you are in an automobile:\n\n * Stop your vehicle in the nearest open area without blocking the roadway\n * Do not stop under bridges, overpasses, or overhead wires\n * Stay in the vehicle until the shaking stops\n\n\nAfter the Earthquake\n\nAfter an earthquake, it’s important to follow these steps:\n\n 1. First, check yourself for injuries and then assist others around you.\n 2. Assess your immediate surroundings for potential dangers, such as fires and structural damage.\n 3. Be cautious of loose items that could fall off shelves.\n 4. If your building is structurally sound, it is generally safer to remain inside, as going outside may\n    expose you to falling debris.\n 5. If you are trapped in debris, try not to shout, as this could lead to inhaling dangerous dust. Cover your nose and mouth with clothing and tap on a nearby object, like a pipe, to signal rescuers.\n 6. Stay informed by listening to updates on the radio or television.\n 7. Remember that aftershocks can occur for a period of time after the main earthquake, so remain\n    vigilant and prepared for further tremors.\n\nEvacuation\n\nEvacuate after the shaking stops to the designated Emergency Assembly Point (EAP) for the building you are in if any of the below occurs or are noted:\n\n * Smoke and/or fire\n * Fire and/or sprinkler alarm is activated\n * Other life-threatening hazards\n * Significant amount of fallen objects\n * Glass breakage\n * Cracks in walls\n\nWhen in doubt, evacuate the building and assess the situation before taking further action. Take your emergency supplies, car keys, purse and/or wallet, with you. You may not be able to re-enter the building.\n\nRemember:\n\n * Leave doors unlocked\n * Do not use elevators They most likely will not be working\n * Do not move seriously injured people unless they are in obvious, immediate danger from fire, building collapse, etc. Note their locations and report them at the designated Emergency Assembly Point (EAP)\n * Do not re-enter buildings until emergency management personnel has given clearance to return\n * Await instructions, be patient, and help others\n\nAfter Evacuation\n\n * Be prepared for aftershocks; these may occur seconds, minutes, hours or days after the initial shock\n * Report serious injuries, fires, or other hazards to the Response Team member for the area at your EAP. Give the following information:\n   * Your name\n   * Location of the problem (building, floor, room number, etc.)\n   * Severity of the situation\n   * Indicate whether any people or equipment are involved or are in imminent danger\n * Only activate the Fire Alarm if there is a fire in your building\n\nIf you are trapped in a building:\n\n * Stay calm\n * If a window is available, place an article of clothing (shirt, coat, etc.) outside the window as a marker for rescue crews\n * If there is no window, regularly tap on a pipe or wall so that rescuers can hear where you are\n * If possible, use a flashlight or whistle to signal your location to rescuers\n * If available, pull a manual fire alarm pull station\n * Shout only as a last resort (to prevent dust inhalation, tiring too quickly, or losing your voice)\n * Avoid unnecessary movement to prevent kicking up dust\n * Cover your nose and mouth with anything you have on hand to prevent breathing in dust and other debris. (Dense-weave cotton material can act as a good filter. Breathe through the material.)\n\n\nEarthquake Incident Management\n\n\nPredict\n\nBased on the 2022 World Risk Index Report, the Philippines has a score of 46.86, the highest among the top ten most-disaster-prone countries worldwide for its high-risk levels, exposure, and vulnerability due to its geographical location in the typhoon belt and the ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean where many typhoons, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. The 2023 Global Risk Report also revealed that the top risk faced by the country in the next two years is natural disasters and extreme weather events.\n\nStudies indicate that despite government efforts, household earthquake preparedness remains insufficient. Effective earthquake preparedness can mitigate devastating consequences. Factors such as perceived benefits, cues to action, and self-efficacy significantly influence preparedness levels. Increased awareness and understanding of the benefits of preparedness enhance people’s readiness for earthquakes and other disasters. Moreover, individuals with high self-efficacy feel more empowered to protect themselves and their families during disasters.\n\nChallenges in earthquake preparedness stem from various factors:\n\n 1. Lack of awareness and education Many community members may not fully grasp earthquake risks or the importance of preparedness due to limited access to accurate information.\n 2. Complacency and low perceived risks Residents might underestimate earthquake likelihood and impact, especially in areas with infrequent seismic events, leading to a false sense of security.\n 3. Language and cultural barriers Diverse communities face challenges in understanding preparedness information due to language barriers and differing cultural norms.\n 4. Social and economic disparities Vulnerable populations struggle to access resources and information for preparedness due to economic challenges, leading to apathy towards preparedness efforts.\n 5. Community dynamics and fragmentation Lack of cohesion and existing conflicts within communities hinder collaborative planning and response efforts.\n 6. Communication and engagement strategies Ensuring effective communication to reach all segments of the community, including those with limited technology access, poses a challenge.\n 7. Sustainability of engagement Maintaining long-term interest and engagement in preparedness activities is difficult without ongoing support and established mechanisms, especially when the perceived threat decreases over time.\n\n\nPrepare\n\nRA 10121\n\nAlso known as the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, it was enacted on February 1, 2010. This legislation provides a comprehensive approach to disaster risk management, encompassing all hazards, sectors, agencies, and communities. It mandates the strengthening of the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management System by formulating the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Framework and institutionalizing the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Plan.\n\nExecutive Order No. 52 of PDU30\n\nIssued in 2018 by former President Rodrigo Duterte, it established the Program Management Office for Earthquake Resiliency. This office is responsible for coordinating government efforts to prepare for a major earthquake, defining institutional roles, and ensuring public safety and government continuity. It mandates proactive measures by government agencies to enhance the resilience of public infrastructure in the area through capacity development programs.\n\nAdditionally, to streamline disaster response efforts, Executive Order No. 24 of PBBM was issued on April 30, 2023. This order constituted the Disaster Response and Crises Management Task Force, dedicated solely to disaster preparedness and response. These measures aim to strengthen the country’s ability to address the challenges posed by natural disasters with a clear unity of command and coordinated efforts.\n\n\nPrevent\n\n 1. Conduct of Earthquake Awareness and Education The community is urged to understand the seismic risk of their area and potential earthquake impacts. High-risk areas will receive extensive information campaigns. Residents are encouraged to attend workshops, training sessions, and drills to learn effective response strategies. Orientation programs, led by MCDRM or in-house lecturers, will emphasize the distinctive impacts of earthquakes and highlight available response plans. The project aims to promote preparedness by encouraging residents to prepare emergency kits, develop evacuation plans, and identify safe locations during earthquakes.\n 2. Development of Barangay-Specific Response Plans and Safety Protocols The initiative involves creating barangay-specific emergency response plans for earthquake preparedness. These plans designate resident roles, evacuation sites, and coordination channels among authorities and communities. It includes establishing earthquake action and communication hubs (EACH) teams, neighborhood watch groups, and community emergency response teams (CERTs). Support networks among neighbors are encouraged for post-earthquake aid. Effective communication channels and household emergency protocols are essential components.\n 3. Intensive Role-Specific Trainings Following the strategic assignment of specific roles to individuals or groups, intensive role-specific training will be provided to address the skills and competency requirements for earthquake response. Existing community groups and roles will be considered for integration of additional duties during disasters. Training programs will be identified and customized based on participants’ educational backgrounds, experience, and existing skills. Assessments will be conducted to measure the positive transfer of learning and improvements in skills and competencies, facilitating future upskilling efforts.\n\n\nPerform\n\nEarthquake Drills and Simulation\n\nArea-specific earthquake drills are essential for practicing preparedness and response strategies outlined in Barangay-Specific Response Plans. These drills emphasize immediate safety measures, emergency response, and communication protocols. By simulating earthquake scenarios, individuals can understand the importance of preparedness and rehearse appropriate actions. Moreover, drills facilitate the evaluation of community preparedness and identification of gaps, enabling proactive\nmeasures to address deficiencies.\n\n\nPost-Action and Assessment\n\nCapacity Development Program on Crises Management, Safety Assessment, Search and Rescue, Reporting and Documentation\n\nThe community members need to be trained in safety assessment, search and rescue operations, and reporting and documentation following an earthquake. In many instances, external assistance may not immediately reach affected areas due to inaccessibility. Therefore, empowering residents through capacity development programs is essential. These initiatives aim to promote citizen-led actions and initiatives post-earthquake. Capacitation efforts will also include training residents in search and rescue operations and disaster victim identification to enhance local response capabilities.\n\nAKAP (Ako, Kapwa, at Pamayanan) Kanlungan\n\nAfter a catastrophic earthquake, communities face destruction, displacement, injuries, loss of life, and mental trauma. To prepare for such events, communities identify the safest convergence location during the preparedness phase. An initiative called “AKAP Kanlungan” is established as a community-led effort to construct temporary shelters for earthquake survivors. These shelters are built using available indigenous and scrap materials and are gradually stockpiled with resources from various sources in anticipation of disasters. The construction of AKAP Kanlungan symbolizes community resilience and serves as a statement of hope for recovery and overcoming challenges after the earthquake.\n\nProvision for Rehabilitation and Recovery Plan\n\nRehabilitation and recovery after an earthquake are vital for restoring normalcy and aiding affected individuals, communities, and areas in overcoming physical, psychological, and socio-economic impacts. To prepare, mechanisms for facilitating rehabilitation and recovery will be formulated and integrated into barangay-specific action plans. These will involve a combination of short-term emergency response and long-term rebuilding efforts, addressing areas such as employment, livelihoods, infrastructure, lifeline facilities, housing, and resettlement, among others.\n\n\nResponsible Agencies\n\nIn the Philippines, several agencies play crucial roles in earthquake preparedness, response, and recovery.\n\nThe National Disaster Response Plan is the Government of the Philippines’ multihazard response plan.\n\nEmergency management, as defined in the NDRRM Act of 2010 (RA 10121), is the organization and management of resources to address all aspects or phases of the emergency, mitigation of, preparedness for, response to and recovery from a disaster or emergency. It outlines the processes and mechanisms to facilitate a coordinated response by the national and/or at the local level departments/agencies. Local government institutions are responsible for the development and improvement of local response plans relative to their areas of responsibility and underlying risks.\n\n\nPHIVOLCS\n\nThe Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) is a service institute of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) that is principally mandated to mitigate disasters that may arise from volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunami and other related geotectonic phenomena.\n\nTheir responsibilities include:\n\n * Predicting the occurrence of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes and their related geotectonic phenomena\n * Determining how eruptions and earthquakes occur and also areas likely to be affected\n * Generating sufficient data for forecasting volcanic eruptions and earthquakes\n * Mitigating hazards of volcanic activities through appropriate detection, forecast and warning system\n * Formulating appropriate disaster preparedness plans\n\n\nDOST\n\nThe Department of Science and Technology (DOST) plays a significant role in supporting earthquake preparedness initiatives through its various programs and projects. It works closely with PHIVOLCS to enhance monitoring capabilities, develop early warning systems, conduct research on seismic hazards, and provide technical assistance to local governments.\n\n\nNDRRMC\n\nUnder the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) is empowered with the policymaking, coordination, integration, supervision, monitoring and evaluation functions with regard to the disaster risk reduction and management initiatives of the Philippines.\n\n\nLGU’s\n\nLocal government units are the first responders in the occurrence of natural and man-made calamities, based on Republic Act 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010. Aside from RA10121, RA 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 also stipulates that LGUs have the responsibility to undertake rescue operations, provide immediate relief assistance, and set-up and manage evacuation centers at the first instance of disaster occurrence.\n\n\nDPWH\n\nIn the phases of disasters and calamities, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) coordinates with other national government agencies through the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) especially on comprehensive policies and approach measures in prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, rehabilitation, and recovery of the inflicted population and the entire community.\n\n\nDILG\n\nThe Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) and its attached agencies such as the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP) are on the ground extending all the assistance to the victims and doing the rounds to assure that ongoing monitoring and coordination\nare in place.\n\nThe PNP direct the uniformed personnel of the Regional Public Safety Battalion to deploy its men for search and rescue operations in areas where the damage is quite considerable due to the earthquake.\n\nThe fire bureau ensures that all equipment and apparatus are available at the disposal of the fire personnel during deployment in earthquake-stricken areas.\n\n\nDSWD\n\nThe Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) deploys psychosocial responders to assist quake-hit individuals. The provision of psychosocial aid is part of the Critical Incident and Stress Debriefing (CISD) program, a crisis intervention strategy designed to mitigate the traumatic impact of disasters on individuals.\n\n\nDOH\n\nThe Department of Health (DOH) plays a critical role in providing medical support and health services during and after disasters, including earthquakes. They ensure that health facilities are prepared to handle an influx of patients and provide medical teams to respond to emergencies in affected areas.\n\n\nFires\n\nFire is the oxidization of any material that results in the release of heat, light, and other reaction products. For the oxidative process to become fire, the chemical reaction must be rapid. This is the process of combustion.\n\nThe visible part of the fire is called the flame. The color of the flame will change according to the materials burning and the environment in which the fire is happening. You can also deliberately change the color of the flame by adding different materials to the fire.\n\nUncontrolled fire can be destructive, spreading as they grow and consuming the evidence of their initiation. Many fires can be prevented through public education — for instance, educating people on safe practices for using room heaters or other gas and electric devices.\n\n\nTypes of Fire According to Burning Materials\n\n * Class A Involves ordinary combustibles such as wood, paper, cloth, and plastics\n * Class B Involves flammable liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, grease and oil\n * Class C Involves energized electrical equipment such as appliances, wiring, and transformers\n * Class D Involves combustible metals or metallic alloy elements with combustible metal components\n * Class K Involves cooking oils and fats, typically found in commercial kitchens; also called kitchen fires\n\n\nFire Safety Tips\n\nOne of the most common emergencies experienced by Filipinos is a fire in their home. In the Philippines, house fires are most likely to occur between March and April.\n\nHome fires can be preventable. The following are simple steps that each of us can take to prevent a tragedy.\n\nBefore\n\n * Place the phone numbers of the nearest fire station in your phone.\n * Eliminate combustible materials through good housekeeping.\n * Keep matches out of children’s reach.\n * Oil lamps, gas lamps, and candles should be placed away from curtains. Put out flames before going to bed.\n * Do not keep flammable materials like disinfectant spray, bleach gasoline, alcohol and paint inside the house.\n * Regularly check your electrical installations.\n * Do not overload electrical circuits.\n * Blown fuses should not be replaced with wires or any metal.\n * Never leave a lit cigarette or cigar on pipe unattended.\n * Always have a handy first aid kit.\n\nWhen cooking:\n\n * Stay in the kitchen when you are frying, grilling or broiling food.\n * Turn off the stove if you leave the kitchen for even a short period of time.\n * Wear short, close-fitting or tightly rolled sleeves when cooking.\n * Keep a fire extinguisher available.\n * Frayed wires can cause fires. Replace all worn, old or damage appliance cords immediately and do not run cords under rugs or furniture.\n * Don’t overload extension cords and outlets.\n\nDuring\n\nIf a fire breaks out in your home, call the nearest fire station immediately. Some important fire safety tips on which you must act immediately until help arrives include:\n\n * If you encounter a small fire:\n   * First, stay calm and don’t panic.\n   * Don’t waste time saving your valuables.\n   * Don’t shout “FIRE” when you try to wake anyone in your house who may be asleep.\n   * Check closed doors for heat before you open them. If the door is hot, DO NOT open it. This means that the door is holding the fire back and opening it would allow the fire to spread.\n   * Use any available fire extinguisher. Aim the extinguisher at the base of the fire. If there’s no fire extinguisher, an alternative one will do so; pour a large quantity of salt or baking soda over the fire.\n * If trapped in a room:\n   * Stay low in case of smoke or fumes. If you’re in bed, roll off your bed and crawl to the door.\n   * Put a wet cloth under closed doors to help prevent the spread of smoke.\n   * If you need to break a window to crawl out, use a chair or a drawer, or a similar hard object. Throw a pillow or blanket over the windowsill to protect yourself from broken glass while crawling out.\n * If caught in smoke or fumes:\n   * If your clothing catches fire, stop where you are. Immediately drop to the ground and cover your mouth and face with your hands to protect them from flames. Roll over to smother the fire.\n   * Keep your head down and close your eyes as often as possible. Hold your breath as much as possible to avoid being suffocated.\n\nAFTER\n\nThe following will help you manage the situation:\n\n * Listen to fire service advice. It’s part of their response to advise you on what to do next, in terms of recovering from the damage caused by the fire.\n * Only re-enter your home once you’ve been advised to do so by authorized officials.\n * Do not attempt to reconnect utilities yourself. Let the authorities check if the facilities are either safe to use or are better off being disconnected before they leave the site.\n * If there is any recovered food, make sure that it’s safe. Discard any food that may have been exposed to heat, smoke, or soot.\n\n\nFire Response Protocols\n\nIn the Philippines, fire incidents are typically addressed following established protocols and guidelines to ensure an organized and effective response. Some key protocols regarding fire incidents in the Philippines include:\n\n 1. Local Government Coordination Local government units play a crucial role in coordinating fire response efforts within their jurisdictions. They work closely with the BFP and local fire departments to ensure a coordinated and efficient response.\n 2. Fire Safety and Prevention In addition to response protocols, there is an emphasis on fire safety and prevention measures in the Philippines. This includes conducting fire drills, enforcing fire safety regulations, and promoting public awareness of fire hazards. By following these protocols and guidelines, authorities aim to minimize the impact of fire incidents on lives, properties, and the environment in the Philippines.\n\n\nWhen Fires Happen\n\nThe following are enacted during critical fire incidents:\n\n 1. Detection and Reporting The first step is the detection of a fire either by individuals or through automated fire alarm systems. Upon detecting a fire, it should be immediately reported to the local fire department or emergency services by calling the designated emergency hotline number.\n 2. Dispatch of Emergency Services Once a fire is reported, the local fire department dispatches firefighters, fire trucks, and other necessary resources to the location of the fire.\n 3. Evacuation and Rescue If the fire poses a threat to life or property, residents or occupants of the affected building or area are evacuated to safety. Firefighters also conduct search and rescue operations to ensure that everyone is accounted for and safely removed from the premises.\n 4. Fire Suppression and Control Firefighters work to contain and extinguish the fire using firefighting equipment, such as hoses, water pumps, fire extinguishers, and specialized tools. They also create barriers to prevent the fire from spreading to neighboring buildings or areas.\n 5. Coordination with Other Agencies During larger incidents, coordination between the BFP, LGU’s, PNP, DOH, and other relevant agencies is essential to manage the response effectively. Each agency has a specific role to play in ensuring a comprehensive and coordinated effort.\n 6. Investigation and Documentation After the fire is extinguished, an investigation is conducted to determine the cause of the fire. This information is crucial for prevention strategies and future planning. Documentation of the incident, including damage assessments and reports, is also carried out.\n\n\nGeneral Fire Response Procedure\n\n 1.  Pre-Fire Planning The development of a systematic course of action that may be performed to realize the objectives of fire protection; the process of establishing an SOP for when a fire breaks out\n 2.  Evaluation On-the-spot planning or sizing-up the situation. This is the process of knowing the emergency situation. It involves mental a evaluation by the operation officer-in-charge to determine the appropriate course of action that provides the highest probability of success. Evaluation of the situation is done by:\n     * Learning the facts of the situation by answering the 5 W’s and 1H\n     * Understanding the probabilities of fatal behavior of fire\n     * Knowing your own situation or capabilities, weaknesses and strengths, available manpower and equipment, etc.\n     * Determining the appropriate course of action\n 3.  Entry This is the process of accessing the burning structure. Entry maybe done in a forcible manner to:\n     * Give access for fire fighters with equipment for fire extinguishments\n     * Provide rescue\n     * Aid in ventilation of the fire scene\n 4.  Evacuation This the activity of transferring people, livestock, and property away from the burning area to minimize damage or destruction that the fire might incur in case it propagates to other adjacent buildings.\n 5.  Rescue This is the operation of removing (extricating), thus saving, people and other livestock from the burning building and other involved properties, conveying them to a secure place\n 6.  Salvage The activity of protecting the properties from preventable damage other than the fire. The steps are remove the material outside the burning area, and b) protecting or cover the materials by using tarpaulins (cotton canvass treated with water proofing).\n 7.  Exposure Also called cover exposure, this is the activity of securing other buildings near the burning structure in order to prevent the fire from the extending to another building.\n 8.  Confinement This is the activity of restricting the fire at the place (room) where it started. In other words, the process of preventing fire from extending from another section or form one section to another section of the involved building.\n 9.  Ventilation This the operation purposely conducted to displace toxic gases. It includes the process of displacing the heated atmosphere within the involved building with normal air from outside atmosphere. There are different types of ventilation:\n     * Vertical ventilation Must be worked from the top to bottom\n     * Cross or horizontal ventilation Used if gases have not reached the higher level through the opening of windows\n     * Mechanical force ventilation A method whereby a device such as smoke ejector is utilized to remove faster excessive heat and dense smoke\n 10. Extinguishment This is the process of putting out the main body of fire by using the four general methods of fire extinguishment:\n     * Extinguishment by temperature reduction (cooling)\n     * Extinguishment by fuel removal (starving)\n     * Extinguishment by oxygen dilution (smothering)\n     * Extinguishment by chemical inhibition (interrupting the combustion process)\n 11. Overhaul This is the complete and detailed check of the structure and all materials therein to eliminate conditions that may cause re-flash; involves complete extinguishments of sparks or smoldering (glowing) substances (embers) to prevent possibilities of re-ignition or rekindling.\n 12. Fire Scene Investigation This is the final stage of fire suppression activities. It is an inquiry conducted to know or determine the origin and cause of fire.\n\nSpecific strategies followed by the BFP when responding to different types of fire scenarios can be found in the Bureau of Fire Protection Operational Procedures Manual.\n\n\nSupport from Other Agencies\n\nTo institutionalize the areas of cooperation and coordination of the BFP with other departments, bureaus, agencies, offices and corporations of the government, as well as private institutions, the BFP may enter into Memoranda of Agreement with, but not limited to, the following:\n\n * National and Local Waterworks For providing sufficient source of water, especially in times of fire or conflagration and for the establishment of fire hydrants in strategic areas;\n * Electric Companies and Cooperatives On the immediate cut-off of electric main lines/power lines during fires or conflagration to avoid the danger of the people being electrocuted;\n * Department of Transportation and Communication (DOTC) On fire safety measures on all ports and land transportation vehicle, traffic flow during fire operation and establishment of effective communication system for the BFP;\n * Department of Education (DepED) On institutionalizing the kiddie and junior fire marshal program in all pre-school, elementary and secondary education levels;\n * Commission on Higher Education (CHED) On coordinating with state academic institutions to develop and promote fire safety engineering courses and post graduate studies on fire science and technology and development of fire testing laboratories;\n * Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) On instituting continuing development and enhancement of standards on fire protection and related fire and life safety facilities, equipage and systems;\n * Technical Education Skills Development Authority (TESDA) On providing and enhancing technical skills and know-how of BFP personnel and fire volunteer organizations as well as their subsequent accreditation/ certification.\n * Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) On providing pertinent information in the field of hazardous materials and hazardous waste management as well as collaboration on forest fire and life safety programs.\n * Such other government agencies, instrumentalities and subdivisions and non-government institutions, with respect to future concerns as may be deemed necessary by the BFP in furtherance of the enforcement of the Fire Code and its implementing rules and regulations\n\n\nTyphoons\n\nA tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating weather disturbance that forms in tropical waters due to the presence of the following:\n\n * warm sea surface temperature;\n * high humidity or moisture;\n * convective clouds for days; and,\n * low atmospheric pressure.\n\nIt is called by different names depending on where it forms:\n\n * typhoon North West Pacific Ocean\n * hurricane Eastern Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean\n * cyclone Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean\n\n\nClassifications\n\nThe classification of tropical cyclones according to the strength of the associated winds as adopted by PAGASA as of 23 March 2022 are as follows:\n\n * Tropical Depression (TD) A tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of up to 62 kilometers per hour (kph) or less than 34 nautical miles per hour (knots)\n * Tropical Storm (TS) A tropical cyclone with maximum wind speed of 62 to 88 kph or 34-47 knots\n * Severe Tropical Cyclone (STS) A tropical cyclone with maximum wind speed of 87 to 117 kph or 48-63 knots\n * Typhoon (TY) A tropical cyclone with maximum wind speed of 118 to 184 kph or 64-99 knots\n * Super Typhoon (STY) A tropical cyclone with maximum wind speed exceeding 185 kph or more than 100 knots.\n\n\nEffects\n\nTropical cyclone constitutes one of the most destructive natural disasters that affects many countries around the globe and exacts tremendous annual losses in lives and property. Its impact is greatest over the coastal areas, which bear the brunt of the strong surface winds, squalls, induced tornadoes, and flooding from heavy rains, rather than strong winds, that cause the greatest loss in lives and destruction to property in coastal areas.\n\nStrong Winds This is one of the most devastating and the most consistent negative effect of a typhoon. Strong winds can easily cause buildings to collapse, as well as destroying roads and infrastructure. Strong winds could also damage agriculture by blowing away seeds and plants, making the crops unable to grow.\n\nLandslides Landslides are caused by the precipitation that is present when a typhoon hits an area. Landslides occur when large amounts of water has settled on mountain tops. The intense pressure of the water pressing down, causes soil and rock to slide off from where they were.\n\nRainfall and Flooding Rainfall associated with tropical cyclones is both beneficial and harmful. Although the rains contribute to the water needs of the areas traversed by the cyclones, the rains are harmful when the amount is so large as to cause flooding.\n\nStorm Surge The storm surge is an abnormal rise of water due to a tropical cyclone and it is an oceanic event responding to meteorological driving forces. Potentially disastrous surges occur along coasts with low-lying terrain that allows inland inundation, or across inland water bodies such as bays, estuaries, lakes and rivers.\n\n\nWhat to Do\n\nBefore\n\n * Know the emergency numbers.\n * Stockpile non-perishable food and clean water.\n * Harvest crops that can be yielded already.\n * Secure animals in a safe place.\n * For fisher folks, place boats in a safe area.\n * Ready and check the contents of medical kit.\n * Keep flashlights, candles, and battery-powered within easy reach.\n * Watch out for Tropical Cyclone Warning Signals of PAGASA.\n * Keep important documents in a tight container.\n * Repair the damaged portions of the house.\n * Charge phones and make sure you have a load.\n * Know the location of evacuation center.

from a volcano. These eruptions can vary in size and intensity, ranging from small lava flows to explosive eruptions that release ash and volcanic gases into the atmosphere. The impact of a volcanic eruption can be widespread and devastating, affecting the surrounding environment, communities, and infrastructure.\n\nVolcanic eruptions are primarily caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth’s surface. When magma rises to the surface, it can result in an eruption. Other factors, such as the composition of the magma and the presence of gases, can also influence the type and intensity of the eruption.\n\nVolcanic eruptions can pose various hazards, including lava flows, pyroclastic flows (fast-moving clouds of hot gas and ash), ashfall, volcanic gases, lahars (mudflows), and volcanic earthquakes. These hazards can impact the environment, infrastructure, and human health.\n\nScientists use various methods to monitor volcanic activity and predict potential eruptions. This includes seismometers to detect earthquakes, gas sensors to measure volcanic gases, and satellite imagery to track changes in the volcano’s surface. Early warning systems are crucial for alerting communities at risk.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of volcanic eruptions, authorities implement preparedness measures such as developing evacuation plans, establishing emergency shelters, and conducting public awareness campaigns. Crisis management plans are essential for coordinating response efforts and ensuring the safety of residents.\n\nThe aftermath of a volcanic eruption can have long-term effects on the environment, agriculture, economy, and public health. Recovery and rehabilitation efforts are necessary to rebuild infrastructure, restore livelihoods, and address the social and economic impacts of the disaster.\n\n\nWhat to Do\n\nBefore\n\n * Know the signs of an impending eruption such as the increase in the frequency of volcanic quakes accompanied by rumbling sounds, change in color of steam emission from white to gray, and drying up of vegetation, springs, and wells around the volcano.\n * Know the community’s safety plans by monitoring the latest advisories and warnings, knowing the location of the evacuation site, and preparing your family’s go bag.\n * Each person should be aware of the dangers that volcanic eruptions pose. Volcanic eruptions are expected to cause ash falls which in turn could harm humans, animals, plants, equipment, and structures. Beyond that, fine volcanic ash is also often respirable which can cause pulmo-respiratory diseases if inhaled over prolonged period.\n * Prepare all necessary things to bring in case of evacuation: gas mask or clean cloth, candles, matches, flashlights, extra batteries. Don’t forget to prepare your disaster kit ahead of time.\n * Know which areas are covered by the danger zones.\n\nDuring\n\n * Stay calm. Cover your nose and mouth with mask or clean cloth and wear protective goggles.\n * If you are outside, immediately seek cover in case of ash or rock falls. Wear glasses to protect your eyes and avoid all low-lying places.\n * If you are inside a house, listen to the radio for updates and developments regarding the volcanic eruption. Close all windows and doors of the house and your car to prevent ashes from getting inside.\n * If you are driving a vehicle, pull to the side of the road and stop if there is a heavy ashfall.\n   As soon as the ashfall tapers, scrape off the ash that has accummulated on roof tops to prevent collapse.\n * When notified, immediately evacuate to safer grounds. Stay in the evacuation center until further instructions. Do not attempt to leave the place unless told to do.\n * Thoroughly wash utensils before eating. Cover water containers and food to avoid contamination with ash.\n * Keep your pets in their shelter or inside the house to prevent them from inhaling ash.\n * Stay away from rivers and streams for possible lahar flow.\n\nAfter\n\n * Wear masks when cleaning.\n * After removing the ash, clean the roof and gutter with water to prevent corrosion.\n * Shake loose the ash from plants, furniture, and windows before cleaning them with water. Cover your nose while cleaning.\n * Wait for further announcements related to the volcanic eruption.\n\n\nVolcanic Eruption Crisis Management Plan\n\n * Early Warning Systems Implement and maintain effective early warning systems to alert residents and authorities about potential volcanic activity. This could include sirens, text alerts, and other communication channels.\n * Evacuation Procedures Develop clear and detailed evacuation procedures to safely move residents out of the danger zone. Establish evacuation routes, assembly points, and transportation arrangements.\n * Emergency Shelter Identify and prepare emergency shelters where evacuated individuals can seek refuge. Ensure these shelters are equipped with basic necessities such as food, water, medical supplies, and sanitation facilities.\n * Communication Plan Establish a communication plan to keep residents informed about the situation. Provide regular updates on evacuation orders, safety precautions, and emergency services available.\n * Coordination with Authorities Collaborate with local authorities, emergency services, and relevant agencies to coordinate response efforts. Assign roles and responsibilities to ensure a coordinated and efficient response.\n * Medical Support Arrange for medical support and first aid services to assist individuals who may be injured during the eruption or evacuation process. Set up medical facilities near evacuation centers.\n * Resource Management Manage resources effectively, including personnel, equipment, and supplies. Ensure adequate resources are available to respond to the crisis and support affected communities.\n * Recovery and Rehabilitation Develop plans for post-eruption recovery and rehabilitation efforts. Support affected communities in rebuilding infrastructure, restoring livelihoods, and addressing long-term impacts of the eruption.\n * Training and Drills Conduct regular training exercises and drills to test the effectiveness of the crisis management plan. Train personnel on their roles and responsibilities in a volcanic eruption scenario.\n   During a volcanic eruption, crisis management involves several distinct phases that guide the response efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals in the affected area. The phases of volcanic eruption crisis management typically include:\n   * Prevention Phase\n     * In this phase, efforts are focused on monitoring volcanic activity and assessing the risk of an eruption.\n     * Implement early warning systems and monitoring mechanisms to detect signs of volcanic unrest.\n     * Conduct risk assessments to identify vulnerable areas and populations that may be impacted by an eruption.\n     * Develop and communicate evacuation plans and procedures to prepare residents for potential volcanic activity.\n   * Preparedness Phase\n     * During this phase, authorities and emergency services prepare for a possible eruption by establishing response protocols and mobilizing resources.\n     * Conduct training exercises and drills to test the effectiveness of the crisis management plan and ensure readiness.\n     * Stockpile emergency supplies, equipment, and resources needed for response and recovery efforts.\n     * Coordinate with relevant agencies and stakeholders to establish communication channels and coordination mechanisms.\n   * Response Phase\n     * When a volcanic eruption occurs, the response phase involves immediate actions to protect lives and property.\n     * Activate emergency response plans and evacuation procedures to move residents out of harm’s way.\n     * Provide medical assistance, shelter, and support services to affected individuals.\n     * Coordinate search and rescue operations to locate and assist individuals in distress.\n     * Communicate regularly with the public to provide updates on the situation and safety precautions.\n   * Recovery Phase\n     * After the eruption subsides, the recovery phase focuses on rebuilding and restoring the affected area.\n     * Assess the damage caused by the eruption and prioritize recovery efforts based on needs.\n     * Provide support for displaced individuals, including temporary housing, food, and medical care.\n     * Restore infrastructure, utilities, and services to facilitate the return to normalcy.\n     * Implement long-term recovery and rehabilitation programs to address the social, economic, and environmental impacts of the eruption.\n\n← Chapter 6: Critical Incident Management\n\nCourse Home Page →","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/cover-dispute_crises-9.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-11-15 07:31:47","updated_at":"2024-11-15 07:44:30","published_at":"2024-07-07 10:07:00","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":"custom-full-feature-image","canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"67d66457a551d98de5579fb3","uuid":"71fe4aa1-b474-4299-880e-bd17b47a045d","title":"PRC Releases February 2025 Licensure Examination Results for Criminologists","slug":"prc-releases-february-2025-licensure-examination-results-for-criminologists-2","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) announced on March 7, 2025, that \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"22,245 out of 36,768 examinees \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"(\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":1,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"60.5% passing rate\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\") successfully passed the February 2025 Licensure Examination for Criminologists.

These questions make us eager to analyze every detail of their crimes and behaviors.\n\n\n\"Wound Culture\" and Confronting the Unimaginable\n\nCriminologist Elizabeth Yardley describes our attraction to true crime as \"wound culture\"—we're drawn to the trauma and suffering of others in ways that date back throughout human history (Hankinson, 2017). It's the same impulse that makes people slow down to look at car accidents or watch videos of disasters.\n\nPart of this compulsion stems from our attempt to imagine the unimaginable. When we learn about a person being harmed in a seemingly normal house while the killer later goes shopping like any ordinary person, it creates a cognitive dissonance that our brains try to resolve. This unsettling juxtaposition generates a peculiar feeling that, while uncomfortable, draws us in as we try to make sense of it.\n\n\nThe Mystery of the Criminal Mind\n\nSerial killers are not ordinary criminals. They often have high intelligence, manipulative skills, and the ability to evade law enforcement for years. This makes them a mystery—one that people are eager to solve.\n\nTake the case of Ted Bundy, who tricked his victims into thinking he was a harmless man needing help. His ability to deceive people made his crimes even more terrifying, and the public became fixated on understanding how he could be so charismatic yet so deadly.\n\nEven in the Philippines, people have been drawn to cases like Juan Severino Mallari, one of the country's earliest recorded serial killers.

We want to believe that if we study them enough, we can recognize and prevent similar crimes in the future.\n\n\nThe \"Hidden Monster\" Effect\n\nWhat makes serial killers particularly fascinating is what could be called the \"hidden monster\" effect—their ability to appear completely normal while harboring murderous impulses (Bond, 2016). James Hoare, editor of Real Crime magazine, notes that they embody the idea that \"something nasty is out there,\" which taps into our primal fears.\n\nJeffrey Dahmer was considered unthreatening by police, and John Wayne Gacy was a respected community member who dressed as a clown at children's parties (Bond, 2016). This juxtaposition of horror and humanity creates a psychological puzzle that captivates our attention.\n\nCriminologist Elizabeth Yardley explains: \"Serial killers are like chameleons in that they can blend into normal everyday life, they look like average guys and some of them are even quite charming. They don't look like the predatory monsters that we see in the movies, so there's this idea that they could be your neighbor, they could be anybody and you wouldn't know, and so there's that undercurrent of fear\" (Hankinson, 2017).\n\n\nPsychological Profiles and Patterns\n\nMany serial killers have experienced adverse childhood experiences, such as abuse, neglect, or witnessing violence.

Some killers may also be motivated by sexual gratification, with sexual fantasies and paraphilic interests intertwined with their acts of violence (Magdalen, 2023).\n\nFantasies play a significant role in the lives of serial killers. These fantasies provide an outlet for their inner desires and can escalate in intensity over time. Serial killers often engage in a process of \"fantasy reinforcement,\" where their violent thoughts become more elaborate and consuming, eventually leading to the actualization of their fantasies through murder.\n\n\nThe Role of Media in Serial Killer Obsession\n\nThe media plays a huge role in shaping public perception of serial killers. True crime documentaries, movies, and books often focus on the criminals rather than their victims. Some criminals even gain cult-like followings, with people writing letters to them in prison or collecting memorabilia related to their crimes.\n\nThe template for this media fascination was established with Jack the Ripper. The 19th-century East End murders had all the elements of contemporary serial killer fascination: huge press coverage, gruesome details, speculation, a focus on the murderer rather than the victims, a nickname for the killer, and the dynamic of a mysterious, clever murderer who was supposedly toying with the public and the police (Hankinson, 2017).\n\nProfessor Alexandra Warwick, an expert on Jack the Ripper, notes that our perception of serial killers has been significantly influenced by fiction. She argues that the notion of \"a titanic struggle between two individuals—the clever serial killer and his mirror image in the police officer\" is \"entirely the product of fiction\" (Hankinson, 2017). In reality, serial killers are far less elaborate and organized than their fictional counterparts.\n\nOne reason for this disconnect is storytelling. The media presents serial killers as complex, larger-than-life figures. Whether it's Netflix's documentaries on Jeffrey Dahmer or films about the Zodiac Killer, the way these stories are told can make these criminals seem almost like fictional characters rather than real people who caused immense suffering.\n\n\nFrom Whodunit to Whydunit\n\nOur fascination with serial killers has evolved over time. According to Yardley, \"We used to be quite obsessed with the whodunit question—who is it that committed all of these murders? But now we're much more preoccupied with whydunit—why would somebody do this?\" (Hankinson, 2017). We want to understand what happened in their lives, what caused their behavior, whether their brains function differently, and how they differ from us.\n\nThis shift reflects a deeper psychological truth: our interest in why others commit heinous acts is ultimately an interest in understanding ourselves. As Professor Warwick explains, \"Being interested in why other people do things is always being interested in what we're like ourselves... Are we capable of those things?\" (Hankinson, 2017). This self-reflection adds another layer to our fascination with serial killers.\n\n\nThe Reality Behind the Myth\n\nDespite the media attention and public fascination, serial killers are statistically rare. According to criminologist David Wilson, there have only been a few dozen serial killers in the UK since Jack the Ripper. In the United States, criminologist Scott Bonn estimates that only about 150 people are killed by serial killers each year—less than one percent of the total number of murders in the country (Hankinson, 2017).\n\nThe mythologizing of serial killers has distorted our perception of them. Criminologist Elizabeth Yardley admits that like many, she was first introduced to serial killers through films like The Silence of the Lambs, which portrayed them as monstrous and intriguing. However, after studying them academically, she found that \"they're boring, dull individuals, who aren't really anything like the movie figures\" (Hankinson, 2017).\n\nProfessor Warwick is even more blunt: \"They're not interesting at all\" (Hankinson, 2017).\n\n\nThe Ethics of Our Fascination\n\nWhile studying serial killers can help criminologists and law enforcement understand criminal behavior, the way we consume these stories matters. It's important to remember that behind every serial killer is a trail of victims whose lives were cut short. Their stories deserve attention just as much as the crimes themselves.\n\nThe psychological toll of engaging with these dark materials can be significant. Author Gordon Burn, who wrote about the infamous Fred and Rose West case, experienced terrible nightmares during his research. He would \"come back from Gloucester, fall asleep in front of the television and wake up screaming\" (Hankinson, 2017). After completing the book, he went through several nights where he \"went to bed and just couldn't stop shaking.\" The experience was so traumatic that he vowed never to write about such subjects again, feeling that it had \"taken something away from me that I can't get back\" (Hankinson, 2017).\n\nFurthermore, the glamorization of serial killers can have real-world consequences. Some individuals develop an unhealthy obsession with these criminals, even idolizing them. Others may be inspired to commit copycat crimes.\n\nA responsible approach to true crime media includes remembering the victims, analyzing the systemic failures that allowed these criminals to operate, and using the knowledge gained to improve crime prevention.\n\n\nConfronting Our Collective Shadow\n\nOur fascination with serial killers is deeply rooted in neuroscience, psychology, storytelling, and human curiosity. The interplay between fear and reward in our brains, our evolutionary drive to understand threats, and our cultural obsession with mystery all contribute to this enduring interest.\n\nWhile it's natural to be interested in crime, we must balance this curiosity with ethical considerations. By shifting the focus from glorifying serial killers to understanding the societal factors that contribute to crime, we can turn our interest into something productive—one that helps prevent future tragedies rather than sensationalizing past ones.\n\nThrough responsible engagement with the subject, we can learn valuable lessons about criminal psychology, victimology, and the effectiveness of our justice system, while always remembering the human cost behind these notorious cases.\n\n\nReferences\n\nBond, M.

From GCash transactions to food delivery apps, your data is everywhere—but is it truly secure? The Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173) stands as your shield against misuse of personal information, but many Filipinos remain unaware of their rights and the protections available to them.\n\nLet's explore what this means for you and your digital footprint.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Data Privacy Act: Your Digital Shield\n\nThe Data Privacy Act (DPA) of 2012 isn't just another law—it's your personal guarantee that organizations must handle your data responsibly. As a Filipino citizen, you have specific rights under this law:\n\n * Right to be informed when your data is being collected and how it will be used\n * Right to access your personal information that organizations hold\n * Right to correct inaccuracies in your data\n * Right to object to certain types of data processing\n * Right to erasure when your data is no longer needed for its original purpose\n\nThe law places special protections around sensitive personal information, including your health records, financial data, and biometric details—information that could cause significant harm if compromised.\n\n\nReal-World Impact: When Companies Fail to Protect Your Data\n\nIn 2018, the National Privacy Commission (NPC) investigated a major data breach affecting Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC), one of the Philippines' largest fast-food chains. The breach exposed the personal information of approximately 11 million customers who had registered on the company's online ordering website.

Despite having been aware of vulnerabilities in their system, the company had not acted promptly to address these issues. This negligence highlighted the real-world consequences of inadequate data protection protocols, especially for companies handling large volumes of personal information.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, the NPC ordered JFC to implement a comprehensive data protection program, conduct regular security assessments, and appoint a dedicated Data Protection Officer. The company also faced significant reputational damage and loss of customer trust. This case set an important precedent for how the NPC would enforce the Data Privacy Act and demonstrated that even large, established companies are not exempt from the law's requirements.\n\n\nWhat Organizations Must Do to Protect Your Information\n\nFor businesses handling your data, compliance isn't optional—it's mandatory. Organizations must:\n\n * Implement robust security measures like encryption and access controls\n * Notify the National Privacy Commission and affected individuals within 72 hours of a data breach\n * Establish clear data retention policies\n * Hold third-party service providers accountable for data protection\n\nFailure to comply can result in penalties of up to ₱5 million and imprisonment of up to six years for responsible individuals.\n\n\nTaking Control: Protecting Your Digital Identity\n\nWhile the law provides protections, you also play a crucial role in safeguarding your data:\n\n 1. Review privacy settings on your social media accounts and mobile apps Take time to thoroughly check the privacy settings on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. Most apps have granular controls that let you decide who sees your posts, who can contact you, and what information is shared with third parties. Schedule a \"privacy checkup\" every few months to ensure your settings haven't been reset during updates.\n 2. Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts Create complex passwords that combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or names. Consider using a password manager like Bitwarden to generate and store unique passwords for each of your accounts, eliminating the need to remember them all.\n 3. Enable two-factor authentication when available Add an extra layer of security by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on your important accounts. This requires not only your password but also a second form of verification—usually a code sent to your phone or generated by an authenticator app. Even if someone obtains your password, they won't be able to access your account without this second factor.\n 4. Be cautious about sharing personal information online Think twice before sharing your full name, address, phone number, or ID numbers online. Be particularly careful with information that could be used to answer security questions, such as your mother's maiden name or the name of your first pet. Remember that posts on social media can often be viewed by more people than you intend.\n 5. Regularly check for unauthorized access to your accounts Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity, such as logins from unfamiliar locations or devices. Many services offer account activity logs that you can review. For financial accounts, review statements regularly and report any unauthorized transactions immediately. Consider setting up alerts for account activity to be notified of potential breaches in real-time.\n\n\nWhat to Do If Your Data Rights Are Violated\n\nIf you believe an organization has mishandled your personal information, you can:\n\n 1. Contact the organization directly to address your concerns.\n 2. File a complaint with the National Privacy Commission through their website at privacy.gov.ph.\n 3. Seek legal advice if necessary.\n\n\nStrengthening Your Digital Armor: Proposed Amendments\n\nAs cyber threats evolve, so too must our laws. Several amendments to the DPA have been proposed to enhance protection:\n\n * House Bill No. 892: Aims to impose stricter penalties—including longer imprisonment terms and higher fines—for violations\n * House Bill No. 898: Seeks to expand the definition of sensitive data to include biometric and genetic information\n * Senate Bill No. 1367: Proposes exemptions for data processing during health emergencies, balancing privacy with public health needs\n\nThese amendments reflect the government's commitment to keeping pace with technological advancements and emerging threats.\n\n\nYour Data, Your Future\n\nThe Data Privacy Act provides a solid foundation for protecting personal information in the Philippines, but staying informed and vigilant is essential. By understanding your rights and the responsibilities of data handlers, you can better navigate the digital landscape and protect what matters most—your privacy.\n\nRemember: In the digital age, your data is an extension of yourself.

However, an equally important — yet frequently neglected — area of inquiry is <strong><em>victimology</em></strong>.</p><p>This discipline examines victimization in all its facets, including the psychological effects on victims, the relationships between victims and offenders, and how victims navigate the criminal justice system and society at large (Alliant International University, n.d.).</p><p>Crucially, victimology isn't about assigning blame to victims; it's a scientific study aimed at understanding and supporting those who have experienced crime.</p><h2 id=\"the-foundations-of-victimology\">The Foundations of Victimology</h2><p>Victimology emerged as a specialized area within criminology in the mid-20th century, propelled by pioneering research that shifted focus toward victims' experiences. Benjamin Mendelsohn, often considered the \"father of victimology,\" introduced the term in the 1940s while studying the relationship between victims and offenders.</p><p>His work marked a significant shift towards examining victims' experiences, which led to increased sympathy for victims and contributed to important social movements like the Women's Movement and Civil Rights Movement (Alliant International University, n.d.). This evolution helped establish victimology as a distinct academic discipline that recognizes the profound impact of victimization on individuals and society.</p><p>The need for victimology has grown increasingly apparent throughout the country as we grapple with unique crime patterns influenced by socioeconomic factors, geographical challenges across our 7,641 islands, and distinct cultural dynamics that affect how victims report crimes and seek support.</p><h2 id=\"key-dimensions-of-victimology\">Key Dimensions of Victimology</h2><h3 id=\"victim-offender-relationships\">Victim-Offender Relationships</h3><p>One central aspect of victimology is the analysis of victim-offender dynamics.</p><p>This examination investigates how victims and offenders knew each other and the nature of their interactions leading to the crime (SIFS, n.d.). Research consistently shows that many crimes involve people who know each other—whether family members, acquaintances, or those in professional relationships.</p><p>These relationships often have additional layers of complexity due to strong Filipino family ties, community interconnectedness, and cultural values like \"<em>hiya</em>\" (shame), \"<em>utang na loob</em>\" (indebtedness), and \"<em>pakikisama</em>\" (getting along with others). These cultural factors can significantly influence whether victims report crimes, especially when perpetrators are family members or community figures.</p><h3 id=\"victimization-patterns-and-risk-factors\">Victimization Patterns and Risk Factors</h3><p>Victimologists study patterns to identify who is most vulnerable to certain types of crimes. By understanding why certain individuals or groups are targeted more frequently, victimology helps develop strategies to decrease vulnerabilities, improve public safety, and raise crime awareness (SIFS, n.d.). Research reveals that victimization isn't randomly distributed across populations. Factors such as age, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and previous victimization can significantly influence risk.</p><p>For communities in densely populated urban areas like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao, or in conflict-affected regions in Mindanao, understanding these risk patterns is essential for developing effective crime prevention strategies tailored to local contexts.</p><h3 id=\"psychological-impact-and-trauma\">Psychological Impact and Trauma</h3><p>Victimologists study the impact of crime on victims, including traumatic effects, responses to victimization, and coping mechanisms for healing and recovery (Office of Justice Programs, 2000).</p><p>The psychological consequences of victimization often extend far beyond the immediate aftermath of a crime. Victims may experience a range of responses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, changes in worldview, and disrupted relationships.</p><p>Mental health support for crime victims remains limited throughout much of the country, particularly outside major urban centers. </p><h3 id=\"legal-and-social-implications\">Legal and Social Implications</h3><p>The field explores how victims are treated after a crime occurs, including their interactions with law enforcement, legal processes, and media coverage (SIFS, n.d.). Victimology scrutinizes the treatment of victims within the legal system and broader society, examining how perceptions by law enforcement, the courts, the media, and the public influence victims' access to justice.</p><p>These concerns are particularly relevant given ongoing justice sector reforms and various initiatives by the Department of Justice and Supreme Court to improve access to justice for all Filipinos.</p><h2 id=\"theoretical-frameworks-in-victimology\">Theoretical Frameworks in Victimology</h2><p>Several influential theories help explain victimization:</p><h3 id=\"mendelsohns-theory-of-victimization\">Mendelsohn's Theory of Victimization</h3><p>One of the earliest theories in victimology, Benjamin Mendelsohn's work categorizes victims into six typologies based on their perceived level of responsibility in the crime (Daigle &amp; Muftic, 2019). This framework provides a structure to analyze victims' experiences without necessarily assigning blame.</p><h3 id=\"deviant-place-theory\">Deviant Place Theory</h3><p>This theory suggests that the location of a crime is crucial to victimization, focusing on environmental factors rather than victim characteristics (Karmen, 2019). It emphasizes how certain areas may have higher crime rates due to factors like poor lighting, limited surveillance, or social disorganization.</p><p>This theory helps explain why certain barangays experience higher crime rates and why community-based policing efforts and the Barangay Justice System play crucial roles in addressing localized crime patterns.</p><h3 id=\"lifestyle-and-routine-activities-theories\">Lifestyle and Routine Activities Theories</h3><p>These related theories suggest that victimization occurs when three elements converge: a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of capable guardians.

However, an equally important — yet frequently neglected — area of inquiry is victimology.\n\nThis discipline examines victimization in all its facets, including the psychological effects on victims, the relationships between victims and offenders, and how victims navigate the criminal justice system and society at large (Alliant International University, n.d.).\n\nCrucially, victimology isn't about assigning blame to victims; it's a scientific study aimed at understanding and supporting those who have experienced crime.\n\n\nThe Foundations of Victimology\n\nVictimology emerged as a specialized area within criminology in the mid-20th century, propelled by pioneering research that shifted focus toward victims' experiences. Benjamin Mendelsohn, often considered the \"father of victimology,\" introduced the term in the 1940s while studying the relationship between victims and offenders.\n\nHis work marked a significant shift towards examining victims' experiences, which led to increased sympathy for victims and contributed to important social movements like the Women's Movement and Civil Rights Movement (Alliant International University, n.d.). This evolution helped establish victimology as a distinct academic discipline that recognizes the profound impact of victimization on individuals and society.\n\nThe need for victimology has grown increasingly apparent throughout the country as we grapple with unique crime patterns influenced by socioeconomic factors, geographical challenges across our 7,641 islands, and distinct cultural dynamics that affect how victims report crimes and seek support.\n\n\nKey Dimensions of Victimology\n\n\nVictim-Offender Relationships\n\nOne central aspect of victimology is the analysis of victim-offender dynamics.\n\nThis examination investigates how victims and offenders knew each other and the nature of their interactions leading to the crime (SIFS, n.d.). Research consistently shows that many crimes involve people who know each other—whether family members, acquaintances, or those in professional relationships.\n\nThese relationships often have additional layers of complexity due to strong Filipino family ties, community interconnectedness, and cultural values like \"hiya\" (shame), \"utang na loob\" (indebtedness), and \"pakikisama\" (getting along with others). These cultural factors can significantly influence whether victims report crimes, especially when perpetrators are family members or community figures.\n\n\nVictimization Patterns and Risk Factors\n\nVictimologists study patterns to identify who is most vulnerable to certain types of crimes. By understanding why certain individuals or groups are targeted more frequently, victimology helps develop strategies to decrease vulnerabilities, improve public safety, and raise crime awareness (SIFS, n.d.). Research reveals that victimization isn't randomly distributed across populations. Factors such as age, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and previous victimization can significantly influence risk.\n\nFor communities in densely populated urban areas like Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao, or in conflict-affected regions in Mindanao, understanding these risk patterns is essential for developing effective crime prevention strategies tailored to local contexts.\n\n\nPsychological Impact and Trauma\n\nVictimologists study the impact of crime on victims, including traumatic effects, responses to victimization, and coping mechanisms for healing and recovery (Office of Justice Programs, 2000).\n\nThe psychological consequences of victimization often extend far beyond the immediate aftermath of a crime. Victims may experience a range of responses including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, changes in worldview, and disrupted relationships.\n\nMental health support for crime victims remains limited throughout much of the country, particularly outside major urban centers.\n\n\nLegal and Social Implications\n\nThe field explores how victims are treated after a crime occurs, including their interactions with law enforcement, legal processes, and media coverage (SIFS, n.d.). Victimology scrutinizes the treatment of victims within the legal system and broader society, examining how perceptions by law enforcement, the courts, the media, and the public influence victims' access to justice.\n\nThese concerns are particularly relevant given ongoing justice sector reforms and various initiatives by the Department of Justice and Supreme Court to improve access to justice for all Filipinos.\n\n\nTheoretical Frameworks in Victimology\n\nSeveral influential theories help explain victimization:\n\n\nMendelsohn's Theory of Victimization\n\nOne of the earliest theories in victimology, Benjamin Mendelsohn's work categorizes victims into six typologies based on their perceived level of responsibility in the crime (Daigle & Muftic, 2019). This framework provides a structure to analyze victims' experiences without necessarily assigning blame.\n\n\nDeviant Place Theory\n\nThis theory suggests that the location of a crime is crucial to victimization, focusing on environmental factors rather than victim characteristics (Karmen, 2019). It emphasizes how certain areas may have higher crime rates due to factors like poor lighting, limited surveillance, or social disorganization.\n\nThis theory helps explain why certain barangays experience higher crime rates and why community-based policing efforts and the Barangay Justice System play crucial roles in addressing localized crime patterns.\n\n\nLifestyle and Routine Activities Theories\n\nThese related theories suggest that victimization occurs when three elements converge: a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of capable guardians. People's daily routines and lifestyle choices can increase or decrease their exposure to these criminogenic situations.\n\nFor many Filipino workers, particularly those with long commutes on public transportation, working night shifts, or living in informal settlements, these theories offer insights into developing practical safety strategies within the realities of daily life.\n\n\nStructural Victimization Theories\n\nThese approaches examine how social structures and inequalities contribute to victimization. Where significant socioeconomic disparities exist, these theories help explain why certain populations—including informal settlers, indigenous communities, and those in conflict-affected areas—may face heightened risks of victimization due to systemic factors beyond individual control.\n\n\nVictimology in Practice\n\n\nRole of Victimologists\n\nVictimologists play crucial roles in the criminal justice system, including:\n\n * Assisting with criminal investigations\n * Developing victim assistance programs\n * Researching issues like repeat victimization\n * Creating prevention strategies for secondary victimization\n * Advocating for victims' rights and dignity in court proceedings (SIFS, n.d.)\n\nLocally, this work is often carried out by professionals in various sectors, including social workers with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), psychologists, criminologists, and NGO advocates working with specific victim populations.\n\n\nVictim Services and Support\n\nOne of victimology's most significant contributions has been the development of comprehensive victim support services.\n\nServices like the PNP Women and Children Protection Desks, DSWD's Crisis Intervention Units, and the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) apply victimological principles in their work, though challenges in coordination and resource allocation remain.\n\n\nRestorative Justice\n\nVictimology has influenced the growing restorative justice movement, which focuses on repairing harm rather than simply punishing offenders. The Office of Justice Programs (2000) notes that victimology is essential for the rehabilitation of offenders and their eventual reintegration into society.\n\nFilipino indigenous traditions of community-based conflict resolution, such as the \"tongtongan\" practice in the Cordilleras and similar systems in other cultural groups, often align with restorative justice principles and could be strengthened through integration with formal victimology-informed practices.\n\n\nCriminal Justice Reform\n\nInsights from victimology have driven significant reforms in the national criminal justice system, including Republic Act 9262 (Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act), Republic Act 11648 (Expanded Anti-Violence Against Women and Their Children Act), and the establishment of family courts designed to be more sensitive to victims' needs.\n\n\nContemporary Challenges in Victimology\n\n\nDigital Victimization\n\nAs technology use expands nationwide, new forms of victimization have emerged. With internet penetration reaching over 67% of the population and Filipinos being among the world's highest users of social media, cyberbullying, online scams, and technology-facilitated abuse present significant challenges that require specialized victimological approaches.\n\n\nHidden Victims\n\nSome victim populations remain underrepresented in local research and services. These include male victims of sexual violence, elderly victims of abuse, members of the LGBTQ+ community facing hate crimes, and victims of human trafficking. Cultural taboos and stigma often prevent these groups from seeking help or being properly identified by authorities.\n\n\nThe Victim-Offender Overlap\n\nResearch consistently shows significant overlap between victim and offender populations, particularly for violent crimes. This is especially relevant when examining issues like involvement in drug-related crimes, where many offenders have histories of victimization themselves, highlighting the complex relationship between experiencing and perpetrating harm.\n\n\nThe Future of Victimology\n\nAs the field continues to evolve within our unique cultural landscape, several promising directions emerge:\n\n * Building local research capacity to develop Filipino-specific victimology data rather than relying primarily on studies from Western contexts\n * Integrating cultural competence into victim services that respect local values while addressing harmful cultural practices that may impede victims' recovery\n * Strengthening the Barangay Justice System with victimology-informed approaches that balance community harmony with victims' needs\n * Developing trauma-informed protocols for law enforcement, healthcare workers, and judiciary personnel\n\n\nWhy Victimology Matters to Filipino Society\n\nVictimology is now considered an essential component of the criminal justice system, crucial for crime prevention and ensuring proper support for survivors (Alliant International University, n.d.). For a country with a unique cultural landscape, socioeconomic challenges, and ongoing justice system reforms, victimology offers vital insights that can help create more effective, compassionate responses to crime.\n\nFor Filipino criminology students, understanding victimology is essential for developing approaches that reflect local realities while incorporating global best practices.

By continuing to develop this field within our cultural context, we move toward a criminal justice system that truly serves all stakeholders — including those most directly harmed by crime.\n\nReflection\n\n 1. How might understanding victimology change public perceptions of crime victims in Filipino society?\n 2. In what ways could victim-offender mediation benefit or potentially harm victims within our cultural context?\n 3. How should victimological research inform crime prevention strategies in your local barangay?\n\nReferences\n\nAlliant International University. (n.d.). What is victimology?
