# About Joan Advincula

I am a licensed criminologist with over eight years of professional experience in academia and technical support, specializing in criminology and information technology. My journey has taken me through various educational and technical roles, where I’ve had the opportunity to contribute to the growth of students and institutions both locally and internationally.

## Expertise in Criminology and Education

With a Bachelor of Science in Criminology and, soon, a Master's degree in Criminal Justice, I bring a robust academic foundation to the field of criminology. My passion for criminology has led me to work as a Criminology Instructor at Visayas State University Tolosa, where I’ve facilitated both online and face-to-face classes. I focus on providing holistic academic support through engaging teaching methods, including creating study modules, lecture videos, and advising students on their academic journey.

In addition, I have led and participated in important accreditation processes and events that ensure the continued growth of the criminology program, helping to maintain high educational standards.

## Technical Expertise and Web Development

In parallel to my work in criminology, I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, which has allowed me to dive deep into the world of technology. My technical expertise includes supporting and managing the Moodle learning platform for the University of the People. I’ve developed automation tools in JavaScript and Python, enhancing the efficiency of Moodle’s administration systems.

## A Versatile Professional

My versatility is evident in my range of work experiences. From advising students as a program advisor to providing remote Moodle support and leading intern teams at various agencies, I am adaptable to diverse roles and tasks. I have consistently demonstrated leadership in both academic and technical settings, excelling at balancing responsibilities across both fields.

## Continuing Education and Certifications

I believe in lifelong learning, as reflected by my various certifications in cybersecurity, blockchain, and Moodle administration, among others. These continuous learning efforts ensure that I stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in both criminology and technology.

## Vision and Future Endeavors
My goal is to continue bridging the gap between criminology and technology, using my skills to contribute to both fields. Whether it's teaching students, developing digital solutions, or participating in academic discussions, I am committed to making a lasting impact.
