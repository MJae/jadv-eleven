## Take Concise Notes to Aid Retention

When reviewing material, resist the urge to write down everything.

Summarize key concepts in your own words, avoiding overly long sentences or complicated explanations.

Writing in a clear and simplified manner helps you grasp the material better and makes reviewing easier.

For instance, when studying the Revised Penal Code, condense each article into key points that highlight the main concepts.

These shortened notes will be invaluable when reviewing for the board exam.

## Test Yourself with Flashcards

Flashcards are an effective tool for active recall, one of the best ways to retain information.

Create flashcards with criminology-related questions on one side and answers on the other.

For example, for subjects like forensic ballistics, write a question about different types of firearms or ammunition, and include answers on the reverse side. For dactyloscopy, you can create flashcards with various fingerprint patterns on one side and their classifications on the back.

This way, you can visualize and review critical concepts quickly.

By regularly testing yourself, you'll improve your ability to retrieve the information during the exam.

## Use Spaced Repetition for Better Long-Term Recall

[Spaced repetition](https://www.oxfordlearning.com/what-is-spaced-practice/?ref=joanadvincula.xyz) is a time-tested method for reinforcing learning over time.

Instead of cramming everything at once, review your material at regular intervals to help the information stick.

Use apps like Anki that has the spaced repetition system built into it to organize your topics, then test yourself on a rotating basis.

For subjects like crime theory, create cards with the theory on one side and their definition and application on the other.

## Create a Distraction-Free Study Environment

Having a dedicated, organized study space is critical for focusing on your preparation.

Choose a quiet, well-lit area with all the necessary materials, free from distractions like your phone or television.

For better focus, avoid studying in casual settings like your bed or a noisy room. Silence phone notifications and minimize potential distractions. This will help you concentrate fully on studying instead of getting your focus constantly broken.

## Break Down Study Sessions for Enhanced Understanding

Long, drawn-out study sessions can be counterproductive.

Instead, divide your study time into smaller chunks with regular breaks in between.

This will prevent mental fatigue and help you stay focused for longer.

For example, break up the Revised Penal Code into sections by title or chapter, and focus on understanding one section at a time.

This method prevents information overload and helps with long-term comprehension.
