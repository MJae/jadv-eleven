Defining my job has always been a tricky conversation, especially where I come from.

It’s not a concept easily understood by most people I meet.

One morning, someone asked my mother what I did for work.

Her answer? “She works on the Internet.”

The follow-up question was, “Oh, at an Internet café? Are there many customers there?”

My mother corrected them, “No, she works online for people abroad.”

The misunderstanding was clear.

For context, my mother was 72, and the person asking was my twenty-something nephew.

This wasn’t a one-time thing.

A little earlier, an old schoolmate asked me where I worked. I casually answered, “Right here,” which wasn’t a complete lie since I work remotely.

After some confusion, I explained I work online, and they asked, “So, is it like processing papers for people?” I clarified, “No, it’s like office work, except I don’t go to an office.”

The next question? “Oh, so you make resumes for people?”

It became obvious that many people didn’t quite grasp what working online meant.

Over time, I’ve thought about how this reflects a broader issue in our country.

It’s not just about corrupt politicians or flawed institutions. Filipinos are hardworking, no question there, but we often box ourselves into limited ideas of success.

There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’ve noticed a pattern of low ambition.

Ask a kid why they go to school, and you’ll likely hear something like, “So I can get a degree, find a good job, and help my family.”

It’s a noble answer, but why does it stop there?

Why should our education be about just finding a “good job”?

Why are we not encouraged to think bigger?

Here’s what I think we can do to break free from this mindset:

**Expand Your Horizons**:

The world is much bigger than our immediate surroundings, and the Internet opens doors we couldn’t have imagined before. Whether it's learning a new skill, freelancing, or networking with people globally, there’s an entire digital world out there waiting. By embracing it, we expose ourselves to new ideas and opportunities, pushing us to dream beyond what's local.

**Set Bold Goals**:

Stop limiting yourself to a “good job” or the idea of just helping your family. Why not aim to make a broader impact? Define what success looks like on your own terms—whether that’s creating positive change in your community, or influencing a larger audience. Break those goals into smaller steps and pursue them relentlessly. Don’t be afraid to think beyond the immediate.
If we can shift our thinking, we can inspire a wave of ambition that goes beyond traditional expectations.

It’s time to look past what we’ve been conditioned to believe about work and success.

The real limitations we face aren’t just from external sources—they also come from within.

Let’s aim higher, not just for ourselves, but for the future we can create together.

The possibilities are endless if we allow ourselves to dream big.
