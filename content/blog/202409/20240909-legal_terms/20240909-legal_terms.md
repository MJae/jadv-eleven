### 1. Habeas Corpus

*Habeas corpus* is a Latin term meaning “you shall have the body.”

It’s a legal procedure that safeguards against unlawful detention, requiring authorities to justify any detention in court.

In the Philippines, *habeas corpus* remains a critical tool for upholding individual rights.

**Why It Matters**: *Habeas corpus* cases in the Philippines underscore the justice system’s dedication to protecting citizens from illegal detention. For criminology students, this term provides insight into due process—a crucial part of human rights in the country.

## 2. Mens Rea (Guilty Mind)

*Mens rea* refers to the mental state or intent behind committing a crime.

Distinguishing between intentional actions and accidents is key, as it affects criminal liability. For example, the legal repercussions differ significantly between accidentally injuring someone and a premeditated assault.

**Why It Matters**: Understanding *mens rea* helps criminology students analyze cases involving intent, like those related to assault or murder. Knowing how intent is determined can clarify court decisions and deepen comprehension of criminal accountability.

## 3. Actus Reus (Guilty Act)

*Actus reus* refers to the physical act of committing a crime.

In the Philippine legal context, actions such as theft, assault, and vandalism demonstrate this “guilty act,” which is necessary to prove criminal liability alongside mens rea.

**Why It Matters**: Recognizing *actus reus* allows students to identify when a crime has genuinely been committed. In many cases, distinguishing between thought and action is vital, particularly in criminal prosecution.

## 4. Probable Cause

Probable cause involves having reasonable grounds for making an arrest or search.

The Philippines upholds probable cause to balance individual rights with effective policing, ensuring law enforcement operates within legal bounds.

**Why It Matters**: Probable cause is essential for understanding Philippine protocols around lawful arrests and searches. This term reinforces the standards of evidence required before intervention, which is foundational to upholding justice.

## 5. Double Jeopardy

Double jeopardy is a principle that prevents individuals from being tried twice for the same offense, ensuring finality in acquittals and convictions.

In the Philippines, this protects individuals from multiple prosecutions on the same charge.

**Why It Matters**: Familiarity with double jeopardy allows you to understand limitations within the Philippine justice system and how it protects citizens from excessive legal scrutiny.

## 6. Burden of Proof

The burden of proof is the responsibility to prove one’s assertion in a trial.

In criminal cases, the prosecution carries this burden, needing to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Why It Matters**: Understanding this standard is crucial to analyzing how Philippine courts uphold justice. High proof requirements safeguard against wrongful convictions, highlighting a cornerstone of fair trials.

## 7. Mitigating Circumstances

Mitigating circumstances are factors that may reduce the severity of a sentence, often in consideration of the defendant’s circumstances.

In Philippine courts, factors like mental health, lack of criminal history, and intent influence sentencing.

**Why It Matters**: Recognizing mitigating circumstances helps you see how the justice system balances severity with individual context, providing flexibility in sentencing to address complex human circumstances.

## 8. Precedent

A precedent is a previous court decision that guides future cases, creating consistency and predictability in legal outcomes.

In the Philippines, precedents set by the Supreme Court carry significant weight and shape interpretations of laws.

**Why It Matters in the Philippines**: Understanding precedents gives students insight into how Philippine case law develops. By referencing past cases, courts maintain consistency, offering guidance for future rulings.

## 9. Entrapment

Entrapment occurs when law enforcement entices someone into committing a crime they wouldn’t otherwise have committed.

This concept helps ensure that the justice system punishes voluntary actions rather than those prompted by manipulation.

**Why It Matters**: Entrapment highlights ethical boundaries in criminal investigations, emphasizing the importance of legitimate policing methods that respect individual freedom.

## 10. Subpoena

A subpoena is a legal order requiring an individual to appear in court or present evidence.

Subpoenas ensure that key witnesses or documents are available for trials, aiding the court in achieving fair outcomes.

** Why It Matters**: This term introduces students to the tools Philippine courts use to gather crucial information, maintaining a thorough and participatory legal process.
