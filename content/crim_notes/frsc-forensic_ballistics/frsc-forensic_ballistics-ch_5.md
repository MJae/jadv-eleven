# Court Presentation of Forensic Ballistics Evidence

## Firearms as Evidence

Firearms and ballistic marching play an important role in criminal investigations, as “every firearm tells a story”. The information required to depict their story can be obtained from both the exterior and interior of a firearm, or from ammunition, and can be used to further investigations and prosecutions which contribute to intelligence gathering and analysis.

Firearms and their surrounding area at a crime scene can furnish a variety of evidence. These crime scenes can include, but are not limited to any place where:

* A victim has sustained a firearms-related injury;
* A firearm has been criminally discharged;
* A firearm/firearm parts or components/ammunition/ammunition components believed to have been used in or linked to a crime is discovered; and
* A firearm/firearm parts or components/ammunition has been unlawfully manufactured, converted, or test fired.

A ‘*crime gun*’ is a firearm that is possessed unlawfully and/or has been used in the commission of a crime. Proper examination and tracing (see below) of these items may:

* Confirm/eliminate the weapon as the source of shots fired during the commission of a crime;
* Enable the identification of persons of interest;
* Reveal links to related crimes;
* Indicate evidence of an illicit trafficking network; or
* Indicate evidence of illicit manufacturing.

Firearms-related evidence can be used both in relation to the main crime but can also lead to the building of strong parallel criminal cases, such as international firearms trafficking. Sometimes, one piece of evidence can help in both investigations. For example, a ballistic comparison can confirm that a firearm was used in a murder case but also in other crimes committed in another country, which is already an indicator of the routing of that firearm.

Too often, the value of evidence that firearms, ballistics and ammunition provide is overlooked in criminal investigations; enforcement operations stop at the point of seizure or recovery. Yet, seized and recovered firearm-related items may themselves provide critical evidence of a broad range of additional crimes, such as firearms trafficking and illicit manufacturing.

## Firearm Tracing

‘*Firearms tracing*’ is a critical tool in the investigation of firearms-related offences, particularly those involving trafficking and distribution. It assists in identifying sources of firearms used by criminal organizations and terrorist groups, as well as providing valuable intelligence on methodologies utilized in the trafficking of these firearms. Firearms tracing can also provide evidence which may link a suspect to a firearm. 

The [Firearms Protocol](https://treaties.un.org/doc/source/recenttexts/18-12_c_e.pdf) (UNODC, 2001: 3) defines tracing as “*the systematic tracking of firearms and, where possible, their parts and components and ammunition from manufacturer to purchaser for the purpose of assisting the competent authorities of States Parties in detecting, investigating and analysing illicit manufacturing and illicit trafficking*.”

A successful **firearms trace** will identify the manufacturer and the first retail purchaser of the firearm, using the manufacturer’s records of sale. Where the firearm has been later sold by the first purchaser, tracing the weapon through the history of its distribution chain may also, subject to national laws and recordkeeping, reveal any subsequent ownership and thereby identify its current legal owner. This identified individual (or entity) may be the perpetrator of a crime or may be otherwise relevant to the case or have information to contribute about the circumstances of the crime or its perpetrator. The tracing process may thus lead to evidence that is decisive in solving or prosecuting a case.

A firearm trace is not an indication that the person of interest has committed an unlawful act; it is simply intended to provide an avenue of information for investigative fact-gathering.  In many cases additional investigation will be required to determine the point when the firearm became the subject of the investigation or inquiry, or when it became illicit.

Firearm tracing is a key resource, not only for the development of leads in a criminal investigation, but also for the development of actionable intelligence on complex firearm-related crime and firearms trafficking. The mapping and analysis of national and international firearm trace data may help to:

* Delineate potential patterns and trends in firearm trafficking;
* Reveal individuals and entities involved in firearm trafficking activities; and
* Expose ‘red flag’ data such as disproportionate numbers of ‘lost’ or ‘stolen’ firearms from a single source, or short ‘time-to-crime’, etc.

The Modular Small-Arms-Control Implementation Compendium (MOSAIC 05.31, ‘Tracing illicit small arms and light weapons’) provides good practice and guidance on the steps for undertaking domestic and international tracing action, including the steps necessary to make and respond to international tracing requests as follows:

* Unique identification of the weapon based on its markings and physical characteristics;
* A domestic tracing operation to establish whether the weapon 
	* became illicit while under the jurisdiction of the State that recovered it (e.g. following its domestic manufacture or import), or
	* possibly entered the country by illicit means;
* An international tracing operation, if the weapon is suspected of having entered the country by illicit means;
* The tracing operation (domestic or international) to identify the point in time and space at which the weapon became illicit;
* Action taken to prosecute those responsible for diverting the weapon and to prevent similar diversions from recurring.

Firearms tracing can take place in different moments and contexts of a criminal investigation. It can be part of the initial investigative process of a law enforcement official or can also be requested by a prosecutor as part of a follow up or parallel investigation into illicit trafficking.

By implementing the tracing activities, investigators can make use of various tools available at a national level (for example, national databases on firearms owners, manufacturers, importers, and dealers) and an international level (for example, iArms and eTrace).
