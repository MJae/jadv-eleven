# Overview of Forensic Ballistics

![Cover image for Forensic Ballistics course](../../images/crim_notes-cover-for_sci-ballistics.webp)

**Ballistics** is *the applied science concerned with the motion of projectiles* – especially those projectiles that are used in ranged weaponry. In this course, we are especially concerned with the applications of this science towards the law. Specifically, as the title of the course suggests, we will be focusing on ***Forensic Ballistics*** in this course.

The word *“ballistics”* originated from the Greek word *“ballein”* or *“ballo.”* It means *“to throw“*. If you watch movies set in the Ancient Roman era, you might be familiar with this weapon of war:

This is called a *ballista* and the name is another origin word for ballistics. This weapon usually comes in the form of a gigantic bow or catapult and is used to hurl large objects, particularly stones, at animals or enemy forces.

While the term “ballistics” generally refers to the study of the trajectory of projectiles, the science itself was developed to facilitate the examination of firearms, ammunition, and related objects.

The phrase *forensic ballistics* was first coined by **Col. Calvin Goddard**, named the *Father of Modern Ballistics*. He was a forensic scientist, army officer and academic researcher who was a pioneer in the field.

***Forensic Ballistics*** deals with the use of firearms science as applied to the law. Therefore, it is necessary for anyone interested in becoming a law enforcer to understand the science.

## Challenges Faced by Forensic Ballistics
Forensic ballistics, like most other sciences, face issues and problems in its execution. Some of them are the following:

- **Limited Evidence** In most cases involving firearms, only spent bullets, cartridge cases, or gunshot residue may be available as evidence, making it difficult to determine the exact firearm used or the shooter’s identity.
- **Lack of Standardization** Standardized testing procedures and databases can sometimes not be available, thus hindering the comparison of ballistic evidence across different jurisdictions.
- **Evolving Technology** Advances in firearms and ammunitions technology can make it challenging for forensic experts to keep up with new firearm models and their unique characteristics.
- **Human Error** Human bias and subjective judgement can influence forensic ballistics analysis, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions.
- **Limited Resources** Many forensic laboratories have limited resources, which can lead to delays in processing ballistic evidence and backlogs in cases.
- **Lack of Training and Expertise** Not all forensic laboratories have access to experienced and well-trained firearms examiners, which can impact the quality of analyses.
- **Chain of Custody Issues** Proper handling and preservation of ballistic evidence are crucial, and any break in the chain of custody can compromise its integrity.
- **Ethical Concerns** The potential for misuse of forensic ballistics analysis, such as wrongful convictions, raises ethical questions about its application.

## History of Forensic Ballistics

The history of forensic ballistics begins in the **1493 – 1508** period when **Harold Peterson**, in a book, discusses firearm riflings with **Emperor Maximillian of Germany**. This is the earliest known reference to any manner of analysis when it comes to firearms. The value of rifling was not recognized until the late 19th century.

Around **1835 – 1899**, certain techniques were developed, including *simple observation, physical matching, caliber determination* from an examination of the shape and size of a projectile, and experimentation, that would ultimately be associated with the field of forensic ballistics.

During **1900 – 1930**, the science gained recognition from several judicial systems around the world due to particular events where it become most helpful.

In **1929**, the **St. Valentine’s Day Massacre** occurred. This was an incident related to gangster violence and happened in Chicago in the USA. The investigations done in the aftermath of the event bolstered the reputation of firearm identification techniques.

During the **1930 – 1970** period, more events occurred that moved forensic ballistics forward.

In the United States, the **Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory (SCDL)** began operations at **Northwestern University** in **late 1929 or early 1930**.

In **1932**, the **Federal Bureau of Identification Laboratory** was formed. Similar laboratories were also created all over the world as the science continued to evolve during the period.

Meanwhile, the **Bureau of Forensic Ballistics** was established by **Charles E. Waite**, **Maj. (later Col.) Calvin H. Goddard**, **Phillip O. Gravelle**, and **John H. Fisler** in New York, New York in **1935**.

Then, the **Association of Firearm and Toolmark Examiners (AFTE)** was organized in Chicago, IL in **February 1969**.

During **1970 – 1999**, The evolution of forensic ballistics continued along with significant growth in the number of scientists being employed in the field. New tools coming from various technological advancements of the era, including computers and the binocular comparison microscope, markedly contributed to the evolutionary changes happening in the field.
